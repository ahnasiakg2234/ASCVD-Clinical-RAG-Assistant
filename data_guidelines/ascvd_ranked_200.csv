He has a notable history of atrial fibrillation on dabigatran as well as numerous vascular risk factors including prior myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, and current tobacco use. He awoke feeling well but while talking to his daughter at 9: 45 AM his speech started to slur. He felt that it was ""difficult to get the words out"" which he describes as his speech ""stuttering."" He looked in the mirror and tried to smile and noticed that the right side of his face did not move but the left side of his face did. Of note, his daughter reports that she thought it was the left side of his face that was not moving correctly. He thought there might be some sensory disturbance on his face initially. The symptoms all resolved within 20 minutes and prior to his arrival at this emergency department. A code stroke was called for question of transient ischemic attack. Currently, he only feels lightheadedness and a dull frontal headache. He denies any other symptoms but does not yet feel back to normal. On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses headache and lightheadedness. Denies confusion. Endorses difficulty with producing or comprehending speech. Endorses dysarthria. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, or dysphagia. Denies muscle weakness. Denies loss of sensation. Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty with gait. On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors, night sweats, or noticeable weight loss. Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria. Denies myalgias, arthralgias, or rash. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PMH/PSH: [] Cardiovascular - Afib/Aflutter (on dabigatran), MI (s/p PCI in ___, HTN, mixed dyslipidemia [] Endocrine - Hypothyroidism [] Pulmonary - COPD, OSA [] Renal - Membranous nephropathy <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> <FAMILY HISTORY> There is no history of neurologic disease including strokes, seizures, or intracranial hemorrhages.

Outpatient Lab Work <DISCHARGE DISPOSITION> Home With Service Facility: ___ <DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS> Primary diagnosis: TIA Secondary diagnoses: atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, membranous glomerulonephritis <DISCHARGE CONDITION> Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr. ___, You were admitted with symptoms of transient difficulty speaking and a facial droop. By the time you reached the hospital, your symptoms had resolved, and your neurological exam was normal. We obtained an MRI, which did not show a stroke. We therefore diagnosed you with a ""mini-stroke"" or TIA (transient ischemic attack). Strokes and TIAs are conditions where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: - Atrial fibrillation: we will change your medications for this (see below) - SMOKING: you absolutely need to quit smoking. - High blood pressure: please continue taking your blood pressure medications. Your blood pressure was not significantly elevated while you were in the hospital. - Cholesterol: your ""bad"" cholesterol (LDL) is 88, which is in a good range. You should contine taking your rosuvastatin (Crestor) at the same dose. Your ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) is 28, which is too low. It should be over 40. You can raise your good cholesterol by losing weight, increasing your exercise, and watching your diet (limiting calories and limiting the fat and sugar in your diet). Your triglycerides are still very elevated at 436. Please continue to take your fenofibrate medication for this. - Sleep apnea has been shown to increase the risk of stroke. Please continue to use your CPAP machine at night. We are changing your medications as follows: - After discussions with you, Dr. ___ PCP), Dr. ___ cardiologist) and Dr. ___ nephrologist), we decided that you should switch from dabigatran (Pradaxa) back to warfarin (Coumadin). You were on that medication before. You will get your first dose of warfarin in the hospital, and will need to fill the prescription before tomorrow. Your INR will need to be checked at the ___ lab in ___. You should have your first check on ___ or ___. This can be done by the ___, or you can go to the lab on ___. It is very important that your INR is checked either on Sundary or ___. Dr. ___ will follow up that result on ___. The next check should be 1 or 2 days after that. The manufacturer of Pradaxa recommends that you continue to take Pradaxa for three days whilst starting warfarin, so we will provide you with 5 more tablets to take. During the time when you are taking both warfarin and Pradaxa you should not take aspirin. On ___, you can start taking a baby aspirin (81 mg) daily. This is recommended by Dr. ___ to decrease the risk of further heart problems. We discussed the increased risk of bleeding on the combination of warfarin and aspirin with you, Dr. ___ Dr. ___. Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please follow up with Dr. ___ in stroke neurology clinic. Please also follow up in cardiology clinic with Dr. ___ and in ___ clinic with Dr. ___, as listed below. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ as soon as possible. Your nephrologist recommend that you continue your blood pressure and diuretic (water pill) regimen, and your fluid restricted diet. You should limit salt intake. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - sudden partial or complete loss of vision - sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - sudden weakness of one side of the body - sudden drooping of one side of the face - sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body - sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech) - sudden blurring or doubling of vision - sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment spinning around you) - sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden tendency to fall to one side (left or right) - sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay awake It was a pleasure providing you with care during this hospitalization. ","___ man who presents with 20 minutes of facial weakness, dysarthria, and possibly motor aphasia. He has a history of atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, and membranous nephropathy. His symptoms began at 9:45 the morning of admission when talking to his daughter when he noticed that his speech was stuttering and slurred. He noticed while looking in a mirror that's the right side of his mouth did not move when he tried to smile. This resolved completely. Exam is not at baseline. MRI does not demonstrate a CVA but story is strongly suggestive of TIA. [] Assessment for Acute Cerebral Ischemia - Localization - NCHCT negative, Carotid US w/o stenosis, NC MRI do not demonstrate CVA, MRA Neck ok - Etiology - likely cardioembolic given atrial fibrillation - Neurologic Status Monitoring - neurologically stable throughout admission - Swallowing Status - passed bedside dysphagia screen - Antithrombotic Therapy - Pt's home medication of dabigatran 150 BID can likely be considered a failure at this point, so after discussing this extensively with the patient as well as his cardiologist and nephrologist, we decided to switch to warfarin, with 3-day overlap with dabigatran (as recommended by the manufacturer of Pradaxa); ASA 81 mg can be resumed after the pt is off dabigatran. INR will be managed at ___.

You underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed a blockage in your right coronary artery. A stent was placed in the area of the blockage opening it up and restoring flow to the heart muscle. In addition to the medicaitons and lab work you will need to quit smoking as this increases your risk of having another heart attack. You have made a good recovery following your heart attack. You have a follow up as detailed below with your cardiologist. Please make sure you keep this appointment. We have also recommended that you have pulmonary funciton tests as an outpatient. Please discuss this with your primary care doctor after discharge. It has been a pleasure taking care of you this admission. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions related to your care or stay. You have been started on a number of medications to protect your heart following the heart attack and to help preserve its funcitoning. Please see your medication list. Plavix and Aspirin must be taken daily to prevent clot reformation in the area of the stent. No one except for your cardiologist can tell you to stop taking Plavix. Failure to take this medication as directed could result in a lifethreatening heart attack. In additon to these new medications we also changed your dose of Levothroxine from 300mg daily to 100mg daily based on your thyroid function lab work. You will need to have labs drawn in 6 weeks to determine your thyroid function following this change. You will also need liver function tests and a cholesterol panel in 6 weeks as you have been started on atorvastatin a drug to prevent worsening of your cholesterol and stabilize existing cholesterol plaques. In addition on ___ you need to have your electrolytes checked since we started you on Lisinopril.

You were admitted for chest pain and were found to have a heart attack. This was treated with placement of a bare metal stent into the right coronary artery of your heart. It is very important that you take several steps in order to improve your health and help prevent future heart attacks. This includes taking your prescribed medications everyday, especially aspirin and plavix. You should also stop smoking and we have set you up with a program called Quitworks which will help provide you with resources to do this. Eating a healthy diet low in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates, and instead eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains is an important part of improving your health. Lastly, after recovery from your heart attack in 3 weeks, you should begin an exercise program building up to 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. Your cholesterol is also too high and you have diabetes. Both your cholesterol and diabetes can be controlled by healthy diet and exercise. Your cholesterol also requires the medication Atorvastatin which we have prescribed for you. You should follow up with your PCP regarding your diabetes, who can redraw a lab to confirm your measurement here. The following changes were made to your medications: START Aspirin 325 mg START Clopidogrel 75 mg START Atorvastatin 80mg STOP Simvastatin START Nicotine patch 14mg ","Patient is a ___ y/o woman with H/O hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, stroke, smoking and non-adherence with prescribed medication who was admitted after receiving a bare metal stent to her proximal RCA. # Vasospasm vs Aborted STEMI: Patient complained of severe chest pressure as though someone were sitting on her chest which led to her coming to the ED. In the ED, initial EKG was within normal limits and troponin-T negative x 2. However, she noted acute worsening of chest pain and felt as though her chest was about to ""explode"" and ""pop."" EKG at this time revealed STE in II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST depressions in I and aVL. These findings disappeared on a subsequent EKG minutes later. A code STEMI was called, and the patient was given a prasugrel load and transferred to the catheterization laboratory. The patient was found to have an 80% focal proximal stenosis of her RCA with TIMI 3 flow through the artery. Upon engagement of the RCA, the patient became bradycardic and this corrected with atropine. The stenosis did not respond to intracoronary nitroglycerin. The patient was subsequently bolused and infused with Integrilin. An Integrity 2.5 x 12 mm bare metal stent was placed to the RCA lesion with 0% residual stenosis. The patient was also found to have a 20% proximal stenosis of the LMCA. The patient noted resolution of chest pain after the procedure. The patient's cardiac biomarkers were negative throughout hospitalization. Most likely, the patient had vasospasm associated with her RCA stenosis leading to the ST elevations in inferior leads. Although it is possible that the patient had an acute thrombosis that resolved by the time the patient reached the cath lab, the rapidity with which these EKG findings presented and resolved is more suggestive of vasospasm. The lack of cardiac biomarker eleavtion is consistent with an acute occlusion that rapidly resolved before frank infarction could occur. The patient was treated with Integrilin for nearly 18 hours. She will continue with aspirin 325 mgs daily for 3 months, then 162 mgs daily indefinitely, Plavix 75 mg daily for at least a month, and Atorvastatin 80 mg daily indefinitely. The patient was initially started on a beta blocker, but this was discontinued since her nly flow-limiting coronary artery stenosis was intervened on and there was no other clinically significant coronary artery disease present (LMCA stenosis only 20%). She also did not have biomarker evidence of infarction or echocardiographic evidence of LV systolic heart failure to mandate beta-blockade. Prasugrel was initially given but switched to Plavix because the patient had past history of stroke. The patient will continue on her home blood pressure medications with goal <130/80. The importance of dual anti-platelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis was reviewed with the patient, along with the importance of smoking cessation and enrollment in a cardiac rehabilitation program. # Pump: The patient had echo after stent placement. This revealed normal EF with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient had no clinical signs of diastolic heart failure. # Chronic DOE: The patient complained of dyspnea on exertion and waking up in the middle of the night coughing. Given the normal echo findings, this may be secondary to a pulmonary process from her years of smoking. Because the patient was not taking her levothyroxine, it may also be that her fatigue was from hypothyroidism (and worsening of any underlying sleep apnea). She may also have post nasal drip contributing to her night time coughing. She was advised to quit smoking and was set up with Quitworks by social work. We recommend PFTs as an outpatient. She was advised to continue taking her thyroid pill. # Smoking: The patient was counseled against smoking and was seen by social work who assisted in setting the patient up with Quitworks. The patient does want to stop smoking. She was placed on a nicotine patch in the hospital. # RUQ pain: Patient initially complained of RUQ pain. This resolved on the second day of hospitalization. Her alkaline phosphatase was mildly elevated but the GGT was normal. No imaging or intervention was performed. This can be followed up as an outpatient for resolution. # Hypertension: The patient will continue her home HCTZ-Lisinopril. # Hypothyroidism: The patient was maintained on her levothyoxine which she was not taking at home. Thyroid repletion should improve her lipid profile. # Hyperlipidemia: The patient was not taking her simvastatin. She was placed on atorvastatin 80 mg. Her LDL was 141. Goal is <100, and ideally <70. She was advised of lifestyle changes including healthy eating habits and exercise. The patient was counseled on healthy eating by nutrition. # H/o Stroke: Patient on aspirin 325 mg and started on a short course of Plavix for her new bare metal stent. # Diabetes mellitus, type II: Patient's hemoglobin A1c was elevated to 6.6%, consistent with DM. She should have a repeat HbA1c drawn as an outpatient to confirm. The patient was advised on healthy eating habits and exercise to lower her blood sugars. She will follow up with her PCP. # GERD: Continued home ranitidine # Skin: Pt complained of recurrent vesicles which burst on their own every few weeks releasing foul smelling contents in the area of her abdomen, breast, and axilla. Although there were no active lesions during her hospitalization there were residual scars. The patient was advised to follow up with dermatology as an outpatient.

[]CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 6: 56 ___ FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction. Subcortical and periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease, better seen and characterized on MRI of ___. The basal cisterns are patent, and gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with global atrophy. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the cavernous carotids and vertebral arteries. The calvarium is unremarkable. There is mild mucosal thickening in the visualized maxillary and anterior ethmoid air cells. Enlarged bifrontal extra axial spaces are unchanged since the brain MR of ___. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. 2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease, better characterized on MRI of ___. 3. Mild maxillary and anterior ethmoid sinus disease. . []CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 8: 05 ___ FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Known left pleural lipoma. Unchanged lung volumes. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumonia, no pleural effusions. . []EEG Study Date of ___ IMPRESSION: This is a normal awake EEG. No focal abnormalities or epileptiform discharges are seen. . []TTE ___ Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2) by continuity equation, although visually the aortic valve appears to be more pliable and its transvalvular gradients may, in part, be overestimated secondary to aortic insufficiency. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and mild regional wall motion abnormalities, as described above. Increased left ventricular filling pressure. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with buckling of the posterior mitral valve leaflet, but no frank prolapse. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Probable pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, mild to moderate aortic stenosis is now present. The left ventricular cavity size has increased. Pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension is new. . []MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 12: 02 AM IMPRESSION: 1. No findings to suggest acute or subacute ischemia. 2. Moderate-to-severe FLAIR signal changes in the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally which likely reflect chronic small vessel disease. 3. No intracranial vascular stenosis or occlusion. 4. The right vertebral artery is poorly visualized throughout its course new since ___, which may reflect decreased flow due to a proximal stenosis/occlusion. The origins of the vessels are not well visualized due to motion artifact. .

SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: Exercise protocol: Gervino Exercise duration: 6 minutes Reason exercise terminated: Drop in systolic BP Resting heart rate: 52 Resting blood pressure: 184/70 Peak heart rate: 92 Peak blood pressure: 160/80 Percent maximum predicted HR: 68% Symptoms during exercise: None ECG findings: NST-wave inversion in inferolateral leads 1 minute into recovery, resolving at 9 minutes into recovery. 3 - 4 beat run of narrow complex PSVT. METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi was administered IV. Stress images were obtained approximately 45 minutes following tracer injection. Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged at 162 ml Stress perfusion images reveal decreased tracer uptake in the LV apex and lateral wall. The defects improve at rest. The apical defect may be secondary to motion during image acquisition. Gated images reveal moderately decreased wall motion diffusely. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 41%. Compared with the study of ___, the lateral wall reversible defect is new. IMPRESSION: Reversible lateral wall and apical defects suggesting ischemia. The lateral wall defect is new compared to the prior exam. ___ was notified of these findings by telephone by Dr. ___ at 4: 35, the time of discovery. .

LAD: 70% stenosis in the proximal LAD just before stents which were widely patent. The ___ diagonal branch had a 30% stenosis in its origin. The LAD was a large distal vessel and wrapped around the apex. LCX: The LCX was a small caliber (2.0 mm) vessel but with a large distribution. The ostial LCX had a 70% stenosis in its origin. It gave rise to a small caliber but large distribution OMB1 that has a 60-70% stenosis in its origin. The distal LCx terminated in an OMB2 and two left posterolateral branches. These were free of significant disease. These vessels were small caliber and will be treated with medical therapy. RCA: There was a 30% stenosis in the proximal RCA. The stents in the RCA were widely patent. The RCA was a dominant vessel and supplied a PDA and several right posterolateral branches. Interventional details The procedure was performed from the right radial artery without complications. The indications for the procedure were unstable s/p stenting of the RCA x 4 weeks despite maximal medical therapy and positive exercise stress test, supplemented by a positive FFR in the LAD territory Unfractionated heparin (ACT > 250 seconds) with eptifibatide infusion was used for anticoagulation. FFR was performed and demonstrated a FFR 0.78 after adenosine infusion 140 mcg/kg/min. The LAD was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a 0.014 short BMW wire in the diagonal branch. A 3.0 mm x 15 mm Resolute ___ was placed in the mid LAD and inflated to 14 atms. The diagonal branch wire was removed after angiographic demonstrated patency of the branch. The ___ was post dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon to 22 atms. This resulted in no residual stenosis within the ___ and TIMI 3 flow into the distal vessel.

As you know you were admitted because you had chest pain and a period of difficulty speaking. There was initially concern that you may have had a stroke however a MRI did not show any changes. Therefore your symptoms were most likely due to a transient ischemic attack. In terms of your chest pain you were ruled out for a heart attack with blood tests. A stress test showed some concerning feature and you underwent a cardiac catheterization with placement of ___. Your medications were also changed to help improve your pain. You are being sent home with a holter heart monitor; the team from the lab trained you on its use and how to send the reports to your cardiologist. You should also weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. ","[] BRIEF CLINICAL COURSE: ___ w/ H/O CAD s/p multiple PCIs including rotational atherectomy, stenting and balloon angioplasty of the proximal RCA, RPDA, LCx and LAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, moderate aortic insufficiency, moderate tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension, cerebrovascular disease with transient ischemic attacks s/p left carotid endarterectomy and stage 4 chronic kidney disease presenting with left arm and neck pain, c/f TIA. The patient underwent a thorough TIA workup which was non revealing and was catheterized with placement of DES in LAD after failing his stress test. . [] ACTIVE ISSUES: # UNSTABLE ANGINA: Patient has an extensive history of CAD with multiple PCIs, including rotational artherectomy, stunting and balloon angioplasty of the proximal RCA, RPDA, LCx, and LAD. Most recently, the patient had a cath on ___ with BMS to the RCA; the procedure was complicated by dissection, necessitating placement of two further bare metal stents. On this admission, the patient had atypical chest pain with the epicenter in the left armpit that initially radiated upward and to the left towards the right jaw; this pain was different from prior anginal episodes and EKGs were largely unremarkable. His presentation, with a transient expressive aphasia was more concerning for TIA on admission. Cardiac enzymes were negative X 3 and his chest pain waned. After concern for TIA had diminished after consulting with neurology, the patient underwent a stress test in which he exercised for total 6 minutes on Gervino Protocol with an estimated maximum MET capacity of ___ METS with the test being stopped due to drop in systolic blood pressure. Given this outcome, the patient was prepped for cardiac catheterization with pre/post contrast hydration. During the cardiac catheterization, a ___ ___ was placed to the LAD, ffr normal after. Medical management for circ and left main disease was recommended, and the patient was maintained on integrillin for 18hrs, got 300 plavix, with close urine output monitoring. We also optimized the patient's anti-anginal meds: Isosorbide Dinitrate was increased to 40 mg PO/NG TID then switched to 120mg imdur. At discharge, the patient was chest pain free and cleared by physical therapy for return to home. . # Transient Expressive Aphasia: Patient with h/o TIA's ___ years prior. Presentation for this admission c/f TIA given expressive aphasia for 1.5 minutes. Neurology notified of patient once on the floor and came to bedside for eval. Non contrast CT head, no evidence of intracranial bleed and the patient was allowed to have permissive HTN to BP < 180 systolic. Neuro followed the patient during this admission; MRA final read no evidence of acute stroke, chronic small vessel ischemia apparent, no findings to suggest acute or subacute ischemia and patent bilateral carotid arteries. TTE, compared to prior study from ___, mild to mod AS now present. We continued the patient on ASA, plavix. The patient will be closely followed as an outpatient. . []CHRONIC ISSUES: # : PUMP: TTE on ___ compared to prior study from ___, mild to mod AS now present, pulm artery diastolic HTN is new. . # HTN: On admission, given concern for a TIA, the patient was allowed to have permissive HTN to 180 systolic. His systolic pressures were in the 150-170 range for the first 2 days of this admission and by discharge, pressures were 110-140 systolic. The patient was given hydralazine PRN, continued on metoprolol, furosemide, and isosorbide as above for angina. The patient's home dose of valsartan was restarted at discharge. . # HLD: We continued atorvastatin 80mg daily . # CKD: Cr 2.2 on admission. Known Stage 4 CKD, Cr baseline ~2.0. We trended his creatinine throughout this admission. Creatinine remained stable throughout this hospitalization. He received pre/post-contrast IVF hydration, gentle given cardiac disease. He will have close monitoring of his serum chemistries as an outpatient. . []TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -The patient was discharged with a holter event monitor that will be managed by his outpatient cardiologist. -The patient had a significant contrast load given his CKD and will require outpatient monitoring of his creatinine post cath.

Anticoagulation: Other medication: Lidocaine 5ml subq Cardiac Cath Supplies Used: - ALLEGIANCE, CUSTOM STERILE PACK - MERIT, LEFT HEART KIT COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system reveale single vessel coronary artery disease. The LM was free from angiographic disease. The LAD had a short segment of myocardial bridge proximally with 20% focal disease; the single diagonal branch takes off relatively proximally and has 40% tubular proximal disease; the distal LAD filled the distal RPDA retrogradely. The LCx is a hyperdominant vessel giving rise to 4 OM branches. The AV groove LCx is a well developed vessel; the OM3 and OM4 also supply bridging collaterals to the distal RPDA; well developed atrial branch is also noted. The RCA is a non-dominant vessel occluded proximally with a ""peaked"" appearance suggestive of recent occlusion; the occlusion is past the takeoff of the conus branch and just beyond the sinus node and a small RV branch; the distal RPDA reconsituted via collateral with the LAD (mostly) and the OM3-4. sided filling pressure LVEDP of 19mmHg. There was mild aortic stensosis with a peak-to-peak gradient of 30mmHg. There was severely elevated systemic arterial pressure of 186/104mmHg. 3. Left ventriculography revealed mitral regurgitaion, and LVEF of 60% and somewhat sluggish inferior wall. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Single vessel CAD with total occlusion of the proximal RCA. 2. Mild disease in the D1 and mid LAD with myocardial bridge in the proximal-mid LAD. 3. Elevated LVEDP consistent with mild-moderate diastolic dysfunction. 4. Normal LVEF without MR. 5. Medical therapy. 6. Mild aortic stenosis. ___. ___ (___) Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Free wall motion could not be assessed, but may be hypokinetic. The aortic sinus is normal in diameter. The aortic valve leaflets may be mildly thickened. Mild aortic regurgitation is suggested. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Technicaly suboptimal study. Normal biventricular cavity size with low normal global left ventricular systolic function. ? Mild aortic regurgitation. At least mild mitral regurgitation. If clinincally indicated, a ___ study by laboratory personnel/sonographer is suggested. ___. ___ (___) The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#) but mobile. An increased velocity is detected across the valve which likely represents high output, though cannot fully exclude mild aortic stenosis. Very mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Possible mild aortic valve stenosis (vs. high output). Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Very mild aortic regurgitation.

You were unresponsive but it is unclear why. You were defibrillated and brought to ___ ___, then transferred to ___. A cardiac catheterization showed that you have blockages in your heart arteries but they did not appear to cause your collapse. We did not place any stents at this time. An Electrophysiology doctor team saw you here and did not think that you need to have any further workup for an irregular heart rhythm. You did have a heart attack and we started many new medicines to help your heart recover from the heart attack. It is very important that you take these medicines every day and go to the scheduled doctor's appointments. You also need to stop drinking and smoking to prevent another similar incident and to help the medicines work. A neurology team evaluated you and thought that your forgetfulness and unsteadiness is due to your collapse and possible lack of oxygen to your brain. They do not think that more tests are necessary and they feel that you will improve gradually. . Start taking the following medicines: 1. Aspirin 325 mg daily to prevent another heart attack 2. Plavix 75 mg daily to prevent another hear attack 3. Atorvastatin 80 mg daily to prevent further blockages in your arteries. 4. Metoprolol 50 mg daily to slow your heart rate and prevent another heart attack 5. Lisinopril 10 mg daily to lower your blood pressure 6. Nitroglycerin under your tongue as directed for chest pain 7. Folic acid 1 mg daily and thiamine 100 mg daily for nutritional reasons as you were drinking heavily 8. Nicotine patch one daily to help you quit smoking. ","___ male with alcohol abuse and no other significant past medical history became unconscious at a bar with resultant CPR for ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was taken to an OSH where he was thought to have ventricular fibrillation arrest s/p shock x1 and transferred to ___ for further care with cardiac cath showing recent RCA occlusion suggestive of ischemic mechanism for arrest and aortic stenosis. Hospital course complicated by femoral groin site bleed, alcohol withdrawal, severe systemic hypertension, and encephalopathy. # One vessel coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest The patient arrived intubated for airway protection in setting of cardiac arrest. Etiology of cardiac arrest may be related to RCA occlusion; however, complete data are not available especially from EMS to state whether or not this was a true cardiac arrest as no rhythm strips are available from EMS. The OSH documented ventricular fibrillation; however, only one strip available in the chart and per electrophysiology review, uncertain if represents such arrest. No further work-up for abnormal heart rhythm was advised by EP. Initial ECG on admission showed ST-elevation in V1, III, and aVF with j-point depression in V2 and non-specific ST-T abnormalities. Cardiac biomarkers peaked with troponinT peak of 1.51 and CK-MB 214 and trended down with some component likely attributable to CPR and electrical shock during resuscitation. Therapeutic hypothermia was not initiated in the ___ emergency department as mental status was not impaired. He was started on empiric treatment for ACS including nitroglycerin infusion secondary to high systemic hypertension in setting of alcohol withdrawal and underwent c. cath showing one-vessel coronary artery disease with peaked appearance of RCA suggestive of recent occlusion. There was no intervention performed as there appeared to be collaterals to PDA and right-sided vessels from LCx, the lesion appeared to be acute-on-chronic with LCx-dominant anatomy, and RCA did not supply a significant amount of myocardium at baseline LVEF > 55 %) After extubation, patient reported several day history of chest discomfort supporting likely possible ischemic etiology of arrest. Cardiac cath was complicated by left femoral groin site bleed secondary to patient leg movement despite instructions. Pressure was held for 20 minutes. Bedside US did not indicate pseudoaneurysm. On discharge, there was a soft hematoma measuring at least 2 cm x 2 cm around the area with no femoral bruit. The patient continued to report severe chest pain consistent with MSK etiologies especially in setting of recent CPR with serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers not suggestive of acute ischemic event. His pain was treated with oxycodone. CXR was not suggestive of rib fractures. He remained in NSR throughout hospitalization. Labs indicated A1c 5.6 and cholesterol panel of total cholesterol 182, ___ 90, HDL 67, LDL 97. He was discharged on aspirin 325 mg PO qD, atorvastatin 80 mg PO qD, clopidogrel 75 mg PO qD, lisinopril 10 mg PO qD, and metoprolol succinate 50 mg PO qD. He will ___ with cardiology after discharge for aggressive medical optimization. # Mild aortic stenosis Patient endorses family history of aortic stenosis with possible bicuspid valve in family member. C. cath indicated peak-to-peak gradient of 30 mmHg suggestive of mild aortic stenosis. He will ___ with cardiology as above. # Probable peripheral vascular disease Patient reported symptoms of claudication and exam significant for disparate pulses notably in femoral area. He will ___ with cardiology for further evaluation. # Alcohol abuse with alcohol withdrawal and tobacco abuse The patient was actively drinking about ___ drinks per day. It is uncertain what ""a drink"" constitutes for the patient, so his effective alcohol intake may be much higher than ___ days. He was given a banana bag and nutritional supplementation in addition to other supportive measures. He has had withdrawal symptoms in the past without a history of seizures or DTs. He also has concurrent substance abuse with marijuana. Urine tox was negative for other substances such as cocaine. He was placed on a CIWA scale and treated for withdrawal. He had not seizures or adverse events related to alcohol withdrawal during hospitalization. Social work was consulted and discussed substance abuse. Patient plans to schedule outpatient evaluation including mental health appointment for treatment of anxiety symptoms. # Transaminitis Admission LFTs significant for ALT 45, AST 74 and CPK in ___ supporting a potential muscular etiology in setting of CPR and electrical shocks. LFTs trended down to ALT 49, AST 60 with no disturbances in synthetic markers such as Tbili or INR. Given concurrent alcohol abuse, it is uncertain if another process such as a primary liver process is contributing somewhat to elevation. Repeat LFTs and CK are advised at PCP ___. He was discharged on a multivitamin, folate, and thiamine. # Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy The patient seemed to be inattentive. Occupational therapy evaluation noted severe short term memory deficits, decreased safety awareness, and issues with functional mobility and balance. His function was below baseline level and required verbal cues to be safe. Cognitive rehab secondary to impulsiveness, cognitive impairments, and poor insight was recommended. Exam was significant for positive romberg, nystagmus, and ataxia. Given concern for ___'s encephalopathy, neurology was consulted with impression of subtle cerebellar deficits and mild ataxia on finger to nose. These findings were thought to be due to combination of pre-existing cerebellar atrophy secondary to alcohol abuse as well as possible mild anoxic brain injury due to cardiac arrest. It was also thought that the component of inattentiveness may be secondary to resolving encephalopathy due to alcohol withdrawal. ___'s encephalopathy was unlikely given that he lacked ophthalmoplegia. Overall, it was felt that the patient will likely improve over time. He should ___ in the cognitive neurology clinic if cognition remains problematic in ___ weeks. He was discharged home with 24-hour supervision by family. CODE: full COMM: ___ ___, girlfriend. Father - HCP - ___ - ___, cell ___. ",4904,1320,15

You were found to have very high blood pressure, and lab tests (specifically, cardiac enzymes) showed us that you had a heart attack. We controlled your pain and blood pressure with medications through the IV (specifically, morphine and nitroglycerine). You underwent a procedure called a cardiac catheterization, which allowed us to look at the blood vessels in your heart. We saw that you had a blockage in one of them (specifically, at the far end of the left circumflex artery, also known as the distal LCx), which was opened with a small balloon. A metal tube, called a stent, was placed in this artery to help keep it open. You tolerated this procedure well, and did not have any further chest pain after this procedure. You then had an echocardiogram, or an ultrasound picture of your heart. This picture showed us that your heart's ability to squeeze and pump blood was still within the normal range. In addition, we monitored your heart during this hospital stay, and it showed slow heart rates with normal heart rhythm (also called sinus bradycardia). Due to this heart attack, you received several medications that you shall need to continue after leaving the hospital. Most importantly, you were started on aspirin at a dose of 81 mg every day (also known as a ""baby aspirin"") and clopidogrel (also called Plavix) at a dose of 75 mg every day. These medications help to keep your stent open. Missing even a single dose of either of these medications could cause a massive heart attack and/or death. It is very important that you do not stop taking these two medications without first speaking with a cardiologist. In addition, you were started on a medication called atorvastatin (also called Lipitor) at a dose of 80 mg every evening. This medication is to keep your heart arteries healthy, to prevent future heart attacks, and to lower your cholesterol. This medication has specifically been proven to help patients live longer after a heart attack. For your high blood pressure, you were started on a new medication called amlodipine (also called Norvasc) at a dose of 10 mg every day. We continued your old high blood pressure medication, called lisinopril, still at the same dose of 10 mg every day. We would like you to continue using both of these medications for high blood pressure.

Your blood work and EKG showed you had a heart attack. You were transferred to ___ for a cardiac catheterization in which a drug coated stent was placed to open a blockage in the stent that is in your bypass graft of your posterior descending coronary artery. Instructions regarding the care of the access sites are included with your discharge information. An echocardiogram showed your heart's pumping function is still normal. Please continue your current medications with the following changes: - Continue Aspirin 81 mg daily, lifelong. - Continue Plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily, you should take this for a minimum of one year and ONLY stop when told by a cardiologist specifically. - Start Atorvastatin 80 mg nightly for high cholesterol. - Stop lovastatin - Increase lisinopril to 30 mg daily for your high blood pressure Quitting smoking is one of the most important things you can do for your health. It can be very difficult to quit smoking. Don't give up! Please discuss quitting smoking at your follow up appointment with your primary care doctor if you were not ready to discuss a quitting plan before leaving the hospital. It is very important to take all of your heart healthy medications. In particular, aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot to form in your heart stents, which can be life threatening. Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications. It is strongly recommended that you attend a cardiac rehab program. A referral form was provided to you that lists the locations of these programs. Please bring this with you to your follow up visit with your cardiologist, and they will inform you when it is safe to begin a program.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted for an interventional cardiac procedure to open-up a partially blocked blood vessel to your heart. This blockage had been causing you chest pain. A drug eluting stent was placed in this blood vessel. These stents require that you take aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) for at least one year or possibly longer. Do not stop taking aspirin and clopidogrel for any reason unless Dr. ___ you this is OK. You risk clotting off the stent and causing another heart attack if you do not continue these medicines. Because aspirin is an important blood thinner, and you were allergic to it, you had aspirin desensitization. This was successful and you can now take aspirin and should take this medicine every day for the rest of your life. The following changes were made to your medications: ** STOP nexium, take pantoprazole instead for your heartburn. ** START aspirin 325mg by mouth once daily for at least one year to prevent the stent from clotting off. ** START Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg by mouth once daily for at least one year to prevent the stent from clotting off ** START lisinopril 5mg by mouth once daily to lower your blood pressure ** STOP taking simvastatin, start atorvastatin 80mg by mouth once daily to lower your cholesterol ** START nicotine patch every day to help you quit smoking. This is the most important thing you can do for your health. ** STOP taking metoprolol for now, Dr. ___ restart this medicine next week if your blood pressure has improved ","___ with GERD, COPD with unstable angina with negative cardiac enzymes found to have 95-99% bifucating LAD lesion now s/p cath with ___ in proximal LAD, admitted to CCU for aspirin desensitization, chest pain free. . # Unstable angina: Presented to OSH with chest pain, negative enzymes, found to have 80% bifurcating lesion to LAD. Transferred to ___ for intervention. A DES was placed in the LAD, with jailing of diagonal branch. She remained chest pain free after the procedure, although cardiac enzymes did rise (consistent with jailing). Because she has a allergy to aspirin, she was then transferred to the CCU for aspirin desensitization, which was successful. She was started on ASA 325mg PO daily, plavix 75mg PO daily, lisinopril 5mg daily. Metoprolol not started for the time being as her pressures were in 90's on lisinopril. PCP or cardiologist can consider starting beta-blocker in the future. Repeat TTE showed EF45-50% with akinesis of the mid to distal septum and hypokinesis of the apex. . # ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION: Reported hives/mouth sensation with prior use. Transferred briefly to CCU for asa desensitization, which was successfully completed without incident. She was started on ASA 325mg PO daily. . # COPD - chronic, breathing at baseline throughout admission. Continued on spiriva and advair-diskus (substituted from symbicort as that is non-formulary) . # SMOKING History - nicotine patch while in-house. Smoking cessation councelling provided at length. Nicotine patch prescription given for outpatient setting. She should follow closely with her PCP regarding smoking cessation. ",3226,393,14

Patient was in her normal state of health until this am when she developed acute onset chest pressure that awoke her from sleep at 6am. Describes retrosternal chest pressure accompanied by tachycardia and headache. No associated dyspnea, diaphoresis, N/V or any other associated symptoms. Per patient recording, systolic blood pressure was in 200s. When symptoms did not after approx ___ hrs, patient called PCP who told her to ___ to the ED. In the ED, initial vitals were T97 P79 BP186/113 RR16 SaO100%. Patient given ASA 325mg and SLN x 3 which brought pain from ___ to ___ but also caused hypotension to SBP of 74. EKG showed old LBBB with no other evident ST changes, CXR wnl. Initial labs remarkable for Cr of 1.3, trop 0.04. Due to uniterpretable EKG in the setting of elevated cardiac enzymes, patient taking emergently to cardiac catheterization. Prior to cath, started on heparin gtt and plavix loaded. Catheterization showed diffuse atherosclerosis with likely acute occlusion of left circumflex OM2, and significant stenoses in distal LAD and Diag 1. Angioplasty of OM2 branch was complicated by dissection (no evidence of perforation) and attemts to stent thrombosed area were aborted. Following catheterization, patient had residual ___ chest discomfort with unchanged EKG. She was admitted to the CCU for further observation. On review of systems, she complains of intermittent uncontrolled blood pressure for the for the past ___ yrs with BP as high as 200s. These episodes are accompanied by flushing, headaches and tachycardia. Thorough evaluation revealed renal artery stenosis with normal urinary metanephrines and aldosterone. She is currently followed by a nephrologist with no planned intervention. Of note, despite hyperlipidemia, patient is not maintained on a statin. She previously tolerated atorvostatin but when she was changed to simvastatin for insurance purposes, she developed dark urine. As this was a listed side effect on the back of the bottle, patient decided to see d/c meds. Otherwise, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> It was a pleasure participating in your care during your admission to ___. You were transferred to our hospital for treatment of a heart attack. The blockage in your arteries was opened and a stent was placed in one of your coronary arteries to help keep it open. We also treated you with several medications to reduce the risk of both another heart attack and of your heart becoming weak from having had a heart attack. Your heart also suffered a complication from your heart attack in which one of the walls between the different chambers of your heart ruptured, allowing blood to flow in a direction it normally would not flow. This is a serious complication and requires repair. You were evaluated by our interventional cardiologists as well as our cardiac surgeons who felt that it would be best to postpone correcting this problem until you have had a bit more time to recover from your heart attack. We have changed some of your medications and started you on several new medications. Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed. In terms of new medications, we have started you on the following medications: -Aspirin, 325mg daily to prevent another heart attack -Plavix, 75mg daily to keep the stent open. Do not stop taking your aspirin and plavix together unless Dr. ___ you it is OK. -Lisinopril, 5mg daily to lower your blood pressure -Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily to lower your cholesterol -Amiodarone, 200mg once daily to keep your heart in a regular rhythm. -Furosemide (Lasix), 80mg daily to prevent fluid overload -Metoprolol 25mg twice daily to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack. -Ranitidine, 150mg, at bedtime to prevent stomach upset You should STOP taking the following medications: -Omeprazole (instead you should take the Ranitidine listed above) -Verapamil (this is no longer necessary because of the other medications we have started you on) . Weigh yourself every day, Call Dr. ___ you notice your weight increase more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. ","___ y/o woman with STEMI and total RCA occlusion s/p DES complicated by post-infarct ventricular septal perforation. # STEMI: Pt had 100% RCA occlusion just distal to the acute marginal takeoff, now s/p DES with restoration of flow to the distal RCA and PDA (R dominant). She was started on ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril during her hospital course. ___ showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Immediately following PCI she was in 2:1 heart block, which subsequently evolved to Wenckebach and 1:1 conduction. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout and was discharged home with cardiology and PCP follow up. # VSD: Physical exam on admission to the CCU revealed a new III/VI systolic murmur heard thoughout the precordium concerning for new VSD/MR. ___ showed VSD, cardiac MRI later showed 3:1 shunt fraction, normal RV size with free wall hypokinesis and elevated PA pressures. Her O2 sat remained >93% on RA throughout her course and she was given diuresis for reducing pulmonary edema and shunt, and minimizing pulmonary hypertension. Blood pressure was also optimized to decrease afterload and maximize forward flow. The definite treatment will require surgical repair of the interventricular septum defect. Percutaneous VSD closure may also be an option. OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - F/U WITH CT SURGERY/INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY - Adjust lasix 80 mg po qd - Should have RHC to assess shunt function which could help decide whether patient needs to have her shunt fixed # A-fib: Pt was found to have a period of unsustained symptomatic A-fib, lasting ~30 mins. This could be a result of changes in RA volume and dynamics. Given patient's already compromised CO, atrial kick is necessary to maintain adequate MAP. Amiodarone was started for rhythm control. She was continued on metoprolol for rate control. CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: DM: Pt has documented hx of diabetes, controlled by Pioglitizone prior to admission. She was covered with ISS during this hospitalization. She was restarted on pioglitizone prior to discharge. # HTN - Her home Verapamil was held and she was started on Metoprolol and Lisinopril with SBP goal in the ___ given the lack of mortality benefit of CCB (especially verapamil) # GERD - Patient has a documented history of GERD, and takes omeprazole at home. Omeprazole was stopped in setting of plavix while ranitidine was started at 150 mg po qhs. # HLD: She was started on atorvastatin 80 mg po qdaily (PROVE trial) but it was decreased to 40 mg po qdaily given she was on multiple medications (amiodarone) which would uptitrate her statin dose putting her at risk for rhabdomyolysis.

The patient went to work as usual at 7AM working as a ___. Around 8: 30AM the patient began to experience severe left-sided chest tightness. He denies associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, radiation, lightheadedness or presyncope. This chest tightness was different than his prior MI symptom which was left subscapular pain. The pain was unrelieved with rest and the patient called ___. Of note, the patient was prescribed multiple cardiovascular medications in ___ (the last time he saw an MD) after his previous MI cared for at ___. He was not taking any medications for greater than ___ years due to cost. Also of note, the patient describes intermittent episodes of similar chest tightness for 1 month occurring at rest and with activity though not reproducible with exertion. In the field, the patient appears to have ST-elevations on EKG strip. A code STEMI was called enroute to the ED. In the ED, the patient received aspirin 325mg, plavix 600mg, metoprolol 5mg IV, nitoglycerin gtt, heparin gtt and integrilin gtt. In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a 100% left circ lesion near his previous stent with thrombosis involving his prior stent. The patient had thrombectomy with multiple passes through his previous stent and placement of a DES to the left circ lesion proximal to his prior stent. The patient became chest pain free with near normalization of his ST elevations around noon. The catheterization procedure was complicated by blood loss of 150cc. The patient developed relative hypotension to sbp 80's thought in part due to blood loss and in part due to vagal response to urinary retention relieved with foley catheter placement. With IVF bolus, the patient's pressure improved to 120/70 while in the post-cath holding area. On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

You were treated with anticoagulants, aspirin, and a cholesterol lowering drug called a statin. Cardiac catheterization on ___ showed that two of the vein grafts from your bypass surgery in ___ were occluded. These could not be fixed in the catheterization procedure. However, your right coronary artery, which formerly had been OK, showed no flow, meaning there was a blockage from atherosclerosis there. This was opened and a drug-eluting stent was placed to keep this area open. There was good blood flow through the right coronary artery afterward. You will need to continue taking a medication called clopidogrel (Plavix) for ___ year, in combination with aspirin for the rest of your life. An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) showed that you had new areas of heart muscle dysfunction compared to ___, likely from this heart attack. You also had worsening valve function of the mitral valve, causing a small amount of blood to flow backward in the heart instead of pumping forward. This will need to be monitored by your cardiologist. The most important step you can take for your health right now is to stop smoking. We will discharge you with nicotine patches and you explained that you already have Chantix (___). Smoking raises your risk for repeated heart attacks, and because of your prior procedures and surgeries, any new heart damage becomes harder to repair. MEDICATION CHANGES: -stop taking amlodipine -start taking metoprolol succinate 25mg daily -start taking lisinopril 20mg daily (you may cut your home 40mg pills in half until you are out, and then fill the 20mg prescription) -you have to take clopidogrel (Plavix) every day ","Mr ___ is a ___ yo man with H/O CAD s/p multiple stents and s/p CABG ___, DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia presenting with 1 day of chest pain, found to have NSTEMI due to new RCA lesion as well as totally occluded SVG grafts. # NSTEMI/CAD: S/P CABG here in ___ (LAD-LIMA, SVG-ramus with vein graft to the diagonal was taken off the ramus graft in Y-fashion, SVG-marginal). Unfortunately, he continued smoking prior to admission. Patient presented with chest pain unresponsive to NTG. CK-MB peaked at 49 and TnT 0.52. He had a few episodes of angina at rest since starting heparin drip, ASA, and clopidogrel in house, but these were responsive to nitroglycerin within minutes. GPIIb/IIIa not used because ischemic symptoms thought to be likely secondary to vein graft occlusion. Coronary angiography showed occlusion of both saphenous vein grafts, thrombotic subtotal occlusion of the RCA with TIMI 0 flow into the PL and collaterals from LCA supplying the PL. The RCA lesion was stented with a DES. There was also a mid vessel 50% stenosis of OM1. Chronic total occlusion of prior stent to OM2 was confirmed. TTE showed LVEF 40% (decreased from 45-50% from ___ stress TTE), worsened mitral regurgitation (3+ relative to 1+ previously), and new inferior & inferolateral hypo/akinesis. He was continued on ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin and lisinopril. His home lisinopril dose was decreased from 40 to 20 mg as he had borderline systolic BPs here in the ___. A beta blocker was started (metoprolol succinate 25 mg), and home amlodipine was discontinued in favor of the beta-blocker for CAD and LVSD. Smoking cessation was recommended. PPI was changed from omeprazole to pantoprazole to minimize drug-drug interactions with clopidogrel. # DM: Patient does not use medications since lap band ___ now diet controlled. Last A1c was 6.1 in ___. # Hypertension: Well controlled with SBPs 100-110s, though occasionally was in ___ on lisinopril 40 mg + metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID. His home amlodipine was held, and upon discharge this was discontinued in favor of metoprolol. # Hyperlipidemia: Continued home atorvastatin 80 mg. # Tobacco abuse: Treated with nicotine 14 mg transdermal patch while here. Patient was set up with his PCP to restart ___ (Chantix) as outpatient. He was discharged with 2 week supply of nicotine patches.

Patient was at a neighbour's place, help to fell trees when he experienced sub-sternal chest pressure. He paused, considering that this might be an AMI, decided not to work on another tree, collected his things, walked over the road to his house and called ___. He sat down, the pain improved, then worsened again. En route he developed diaphoresis, palor and began vomiting. He developed ventricular fibrillation and was shocked out of this rhythm with re-establishment of sinus rhythm, also notable for 5-___epression and t-wave inversion in V2-4, ST depression of 1 mm in I and large t-waves in III. En route he was given 162 mg ASA. He was briefly at ___ where ST-segment depression seen on EMS was again noted. He described sub-sternal chest pain, weakness and nausea. He was given aspirin 162 for a total of 324 mg, plavix 600 mg, SLN x 2, lidocaine 100 mg IV, 50 mcg fentanyl, heparin bolus 3600 units IV. Chest pain improved. He continued to vomit and likely lost some medication, so another 600 mg of Plavix was given. He was given Zofran (8 mg) prior to MedFlight arrival for evacuation to ___. Given a question of torsades (unclear but seen on beginning four inches of EMS strip EKG) he was sent on MedFlight with magnesium, but this was not given in the ED. On Medflight, Mr. ___ vomited again, was given 100 mcg more of fentanyl with chest pain dropping from ___ to ___. He arrived at ___ and was taken directly to the cath lab where one bare metal stent was placed in the almost completely occluded proximal left circumflex. RCA was approximately 50 % stenosed at its narrowest point and branches of the left anterior descending, septal perforators and diagonals, were tightly stenosed. Throughout this period from home until arrival in the cath lab, he was hemodynamically stable with pressures slightly elevated from 130s to 150s. Opening blood pressure was 124 mmHg systolic, but decreased by the end of the procedure to ___ systolic. Dopamine drip was started and a baloon pump placed. Given that atrial fibrillation was thought to be new and was likely contributing to hypotension, the patient was further sedated with successful electrical cardioversion. He received 4.5 L of IV fluids in total. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The ___ was free of angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis. The LAD had a complex trifurcating lesion in the mid vessel that was 80-90%. There was an 80% stenosis in the mid LAD that involved the origin of a major diagonal branch. That diagonal branch also had a 90% stenosis. The LCx had a 100% proximal stenosis. The RCA had a long 50% stenosis in the mid vessel. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 16mmHg, and mean PCWP 25mmHg. There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 38mmHg on dopamine gtt. The cardiac index on dopamine was preserved at 3.17 l/min/m2, it declined to 1.58 l/min/m2 when dopamine was weaned off because of continued ventricular ectopy. Following the placement of the IABP the cardiac index improved to 2.3 l/min/m2. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred. 4. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed sheathed via the right femoral artery, with MAP 77 mmHg on ___ counterpulsation. 5. Successful PCI of the proximal LCx occlusion with a 3.0x18mm Vision BMS, post-dilated to 3.5mm. 6. Because of low blood pressure in the presence of rapid atrial fibrillation, cardioversion to NSR was performed with a single shock of 360 joules after the patient was sedated with the help of a member of the anesthesia department.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You had a large heart attack and a bare metal stent was placed in your left circumflex artery. You had some heart arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation that required cardioversion (shock) to fix, and short runs of ventricular tachycardia. All of this irregular rhythms were thought to be due to your heart attack and have now resolved. Your echocardiogram showed some wall motion abnormalities and your heart function is not as strong as it was before but we think this will improve over time. For now, you will need to exercise accoring to your exercise prescription, take all of your medicines and follow up with your new cardiologists. A bypass operation will be scheduled in the future. . Medication changes: 1. Stop taking hydrochlorothizide 2. Start taking aspirin every day to keep the stent open 3. Start taking Plavix every day to keep the stent open, do not miss any doses or stop taking Plavix unless Dr. ___ you to. 4. Start taking Atorvastain to keep your cholesterol down 5. Start taking Metoprolol to keep your heart rate low 6. Start taking Lisinopril to keep your blood pressure low. 7. Start using nitroglycerin if you have similar chest pain. Take this tablet under your tongue and wait 5 minutes between doses. If you still have chest pain after 3 doses, call ___. Tell Dr. ___ Dr. ___ you use any nitroglycerin at all. . ","Mr ___ presented with ___ in the context of a 'cold' and dyslipidemia. A bare mental stent was placed in the proximal left circumflex culprit lesion. The patient will take Plavix and other CAD regimen for one month, allowing for endothelium to appear within stent, before elective CABG, given extensive CAD. Coronary Artery Disease The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and LCx disease and had a stent placed to the LCx. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG changes were likely derived from the occluded LCx. CAD is a new diagnosis for this patient. LDL 121 and HbA1c 5.4 suggesting he does not have diabetes. He was given integrillin for 18 hrs. Given extensive coronary disease, the patient is a candidate for CABG. Cardiac surgery was consulted and it was decided to defer this surgery by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within the LCx stent. The patient was given a dose of prasugrel for rapid onset of purine receptor block, followed by Plavix. He is being discharged on plavix BID for one week then Q day, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and full dose aspirin. He will follow up with Dr. ___ cardiac surgery and with Dr. ___ for cardiology. Atrial Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades de Pointes Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case (concern for new onset MR, possibly consistent with echo, and atrial stretch). It appeared responsible for hypotension, but hypotension continued despite resolution of AF  however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab (sedated, electrical) and a baloon pump was placed. Over the night following catheterization, the patient had frequent bouts of ventricular ectopy with PVCs, VT, AIVR, and one 14 second episode of self-limited torsades de ___. Due to low blood pressures, beta-blocker was initially avoided and patient was loaded with amiodarone and started on an amiodarone gtt. Swan-Ganz catheter was removed to prevent triggering arrhythmias. The ventricular ectopy decreased, and after discussion with EP, low dose metoprolol was initiated and amidarone was stopped. K and Mg were aggressively repleted. Ectopy was very substantially decreased about 24 hours after the event, suggestive of extended reperfusion ectopy. He had very few to no ectopy at discharge. Hypertension/Hypotension Balloon pump was used for the first 24 hours to support cardiac function and blood pressure. He was also briefly on dopamine in the cath. lab., which was discontinued upon arrival on the floor. Systolic blood pressures were initially in the ___, lower during VT, even after having 4.5L of fluid. His pressures spontaneously increased on the day following admission. HCTZ was held. Leukocytosis Likely stress demargination in ACS and resolved with time. Supported by diff with minimal bands and evening cortisol of 26 at presentation. ",5135,688,14

She reports that she noticed swelling in RLE ___ days ago as well as progressive shortness of breath and orthopnea. Shortness of breath is at rest as she resides in a wheelchair and is not physically active. She describes sleeping in a hospital bed with incline at baseline but progressive orthopnea and PND since ___. She had wanted to delay evaluation until after family's ___ dinner (corned beef). She has also has abdominal bloating ""I feel six months pregnant"". She has PRN Lasix 20mg at home which she has not taken in years but did trial yesterday and today. She denies chest pain. She reports L shoulder/scapula pain which is reproducible and associated with back pain. She denies LH/dizziness/syncope. She reports that she has not had anything similar in many years. Per her last cardiology outpatient note with Dr. ___ ___, her ""coronary disease is widespread enough to favor surgical repair but unfortunately her anatomy makes appropriate targets difficult. She was previously evaluated by cardiac surgery but unfortunately was deemed a poor CABG candidate given diffuse CAD with poor distal targets (""small targets would likely prevent bypasses from maturing""). We referred her to back to interventional cardiology for re-evaluation for high risk PCI of the left main coronary artery (unlikely in setting of recent CVA, asymptomatic status)."" Current plans for medical optimization. At presentation to the ED, her vitals were T: 98 HR: 95 BP: 167/87 RR: 22 SO2: 94% RA . She was assessed by the cardiology fellow in the ED. BiPAP initiated in the ED for symptomatic improvement (no hypoxia noted). She was given Lasix 40 mg IV and nitro gtt started with at least 300 cc urine output by the time of cardiology fellow's exam with improvement in dyspnea. A foley catheter was placed. She also received IV fentanyl 50 mcg, ASA 324, heparin drip for NSTEMI although her back pain was reproducible. EKG changes and trop were through to be demand in the setting of known unrevascularized multivessel disease versus acute coronary syndrome. She was admitted for consideration of PCI depending on anemia, ___ and multivessel disease. She was recently admitted from ___ for dysphagia and twitching as well as word finding difficulties without evidence of new CVA nor seizure activity with improvement during hospitalization. Back pain was also present during this hospital stay. She also had early DKA on that hospital stay. In ___ she presented to the CCU intubated for AMS. She was found to have an inferior STEMI and left MCA CVA. She did not undergo cath for STEMI due to bleeding risk in setting of stroke. She also has known 3VD with poor surgical targets. She was medically managed with ASA, Plavix, Statin, and beta blocker. She did not get started on ___ due to ___. For her stroke, she had a work up for etiology. Did not show evidence of PFO. CT-A did not show evidence of carotid stenosis. Etiology was thought to be cardioembolic from transient myocardial stunning in setting of MI. She was admitted from ___ to the neurology service. She was admitted with symptoms similar to a prior stroke in ___ during admission, her imaging did not reveal any acute findings, and she was thought to be having seizures with associated postictal state. She was started on levetiracetam and transitioned to lacosamide. Her hospital course was complicated by encephalopathy, seizures, acute kidney injury, DKA, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

What happened when you were in the hospital? - In the emergency room, you were placed on BIPAP, which is a way to help you breath without using a breathing machine. - You were admitted to the cardiology service where you received IV Lasix (furosemide) to make you pee out the extra fluid. - Your medications were changed around to make them better for your high blood pressure and heart failure. - You were found to have a mini-heart attack. - Your kidney level was elevated (creatinine) and this was monitored. - The chronic pain service recommended we add Lyrica to your pain regimen, which you declined. - We offered to consult psychiatry to assist with management of depressed mood and coping of your medical issues but you declined their evaluation. - We had extensive discussions with you along with your sister ___ (healthcare proxy), your husband, and your mother. We determined that your goals for your care are to not receive CPR or intubation. This is called DNR/DNI (do-not-resuscitate; do-not-intubate). - Furthermore, you expressed that you did not want to return to the hospital unless only for comfort care. To this end, we also signed a form (called a MOLST) that you will NOT be hospitalized. Keep in mind that you may always change your mind about any of these decisions and should discuss this with your family and your primary care doctor if you do change your mind. - You met with the palliative care team and will follow up with them as an outpatient for further management of your symptoms especially comfort. What should you do when you leave the hospital? - You elected to follow up with only palliative care and primary care for now to limit your coming back to medical providers. - Please take all your medications as prescribed. There have been changes to your medication list as described below. - Your discharge weight is 49.8 kg (109.79 lb). If you are able to weigh yourself at home, please check your weights daily and let your primary care doctor know if you are gaining more than 3 lbs in a day. This may affect your torsemide dosing plan. It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. Sincerely, Your ___ care team ","Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with systolic heart failure (LVEF 45%), coronary artery disease s/p NSTEMI ___ with diffuse disease and inferior STEMI in ___ (no intervention), L MCA CVA with residual hemirparesis and word-finding diffculties, valvular heart disease (2+MR, 2+TR), peripheral vascular disease s/p L BKA, current smoker who presents as an ED-ED transfer from ___ for dyspnea and lower extremity edema for the last 2 days, felt to be HFrEF exacerbation with NSTEMI, anemia, and ___. #GOC: brief hospital course predominated by ___ conversations. Patient repeatedly expressed that she wants leave the hospital and was felt to have the capacity to do so. Her specific goals were to go home, smoke, drink CocaCola, and eat whatever she wants. She requested to be DNR/DNI, and a family meeting was held with HCP/sister and patient's mother at which time she was made DNR/DNI. Patient also repeatedly expressed a desire to be DNH stating that she was tired of multiple admissions. Family meeting was had to discuss this as well and palliative care was consulted for consideration of hospice. It is difficult to predict her life expectancy; however, it was felt that given her multiple comorbidities, home hospice ___ would be a reasonable consideration. MOLST signed with DNR/DNI/DNH/no noninvasive ventilation/no artificial nutrition/no artificial hydration/no dialysis. Patient's husband and oldest daughter were also aware of the change in ___ and were supportive of patient's choice. This change in code status was communicated to PCP. Given concern for depression affecting patient's decision-making, psychiatry consultation and initiation of antidepressants were encouraged by primary team but patient declined. Finally, patient does not wish to maintain follow up with specialist providers but is willing to return to PCP with whom she has an established relationship and with palliative care for now. She wishes to continue medications as well for now. # Acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure (EF 45%): ___ class III, stage C; warm and wet on admission to ___ service. Patient presented with SOB and orthopnea with CXR consistent with pulmonary edema, elevated JVP and BNP. She was notably not hypoxic but placed on BIPAP in the ED which improved her dyspnea and orthopnea. The etiology of her HF exacerbation was felt to be due to NSTEMI vs dietary indiscretion vs hypertensive urgency with flash pulmonary edema vs underdiuresis (not consistently on Lasix 20 po daily at home). She was diuresed with IV Lasix 40 during hospital course, including on day of discharge when she appeared to flash again ___ hypertension with SBP 170s. She was transitioned to new home diuretic plan of torsemide 20 mg daily to ensure euvolemia. In addition, her ischemic HFrEF regimen was optimized during this hospital course with the addition of metoprolol (changed from home labetalol), as well as imdur 90 mg daily and hydralazine 50 mg TID. ACE and ___ were not pursued given renal function but may be considered as outpatient. TTE this admission showed normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (PDA distribution). Moderate mitral regurgitation; increased PCWP; EF 45%. In sum: -Diuretics: torsemide 20 daily -Preload: imdur 90 mg daily -Afterload: hydral 50 mg TID; amlodipine 5 mg daily -NHBK: Metoprolol XL 50 mg daily -Aldactone not pursued given hyperK+ hx -Devices: not candidate for ICD; not within GOC -Discharge (bed) weight is 49.8 kg (109.79 lb). #NSTEMI #CAD s/p NSTEMI ___ with diffuse disease and inferior STEMI in ___ (without revascularization) This admission, patient had increased STD laterally from baseline, and positive troponin (negative CK-MB) for which she was placed on heparin gtt initially (subsequently discontinued due to anemia as below). She continued on home aspirin 325, atorva 80, and initiated on metoprolol as above. Troponins downtrended without further intervention. Ultimately, she will go home on aspirin 81 mg daily due to concern for ongoing anemia. #Acute on chronic iron deficiency anemia: patient has known baseline anemia which is felt to be mixed etiology (normocytic with wide RDW raises suspicion for B12 and iron deficiency and ACD). Her home ferric gluconate was held and she received IV Fe repletion according to FAIR-HF trial. She received 1U pRBC during admission with appropriate improvement in Hct/Hgb. Etiology of acute on chronic anemia felt to be due to occult bleeding in setting of heparin gtt (?GI given dark stool vs GYN given hx of menorrhagia, although neither seen in hospital). ___ on CKD: Cr elevated to 1.8 from baseline ~1.3-1.7, with suspicion for cardiorenal etiology. FeUrea this admission was 35%, borderline instrinsic vs prerenal etiology. Cr remained stable over brief admission. #Depressed mood: this was addressed at length with primary team and patient given the concern that her depressed mood was affecting her coping and possibly decision making. However, patient attributed depressed mood to the fact of being in the hospital and states that she's happy when she's at home doing the things she likes. To this end, she declined psychiatry evaluation and antidepressants while admitted. #Somnolence: patient noted to be more lethargic upon initial evaluation, which was felt to be due to medication effect with IV Ativan given overnight as well as her home sedating medications (mirtazapine at 45 mg qHS and qHS po Ativan). Ativan was held over admission and mirtazapine decreased to 15 mg qHS. Her mental status improved and she was alert and oriented on ___ afternoon and ___. CHRONIC ISSUES: ================ #Type I DM: continued home insulin dosing and ISS; glargine increased to 14U qAM and 14U qPM given hyperglycemia to 400s on the day of discharge. Her insulin regimen may be further adjusted as an outpatient. #Back/shoulder pain: Patient follows with chronic pain as an outpatient and this pain is felt to be due to ___ etiology. Primary team discussed regimen with CPS who recommended Lyrica and titration off gabapentin. Patient declined Lyrica and strongly wished to pursue gabapentin. She was continued on baclofen, lidocaine patch, and standing Tylenol. #h/o seizure disorder: continued home lacosamide #Current smoker: continued on nicotine patch while inpatient; discontinued at discharge as patient is a current smoker. Notably, smoking was a primary motivator for her decision to go home. We did discuss the option of her going outside to smoke then returning for ongoing care but patient declined this too. #h/o L MCA CVA with residual R sided hemiparesis and word finding difficulty: patient was continued on aspirin 325 while admitted as well as Plavix 75 and atorvastatin 80 mg qHS. Aspirin was decreased to 81 mg on discharge due to change in GOC and concern that she would continue to have worsening anemia if she were to continue on asa 325 at home. #Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine #HTN: patient placed on amlodipine, imdur, and hydralazine as above #GERD: continued home omeprazole 40 mg PO BID TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient was insistent on leaving on ___ despite primary team concern that her medications would need further titration and monitoring. Please watch BP, glucose, and CBC, chem10 to ensure appropriate dosing. - see GOC above as patient is now DNR/DNI/Do not hospitalize. MOLST signed with HCP and patient on ___ - Please consider further clarification if patient wishes to receive outpatient care.

At time of discharge the patient had stable vital signs and appeared to be in no distress. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ ___. . You were admitted after complaints of chest pain and discomfort. Additional lab studies showed that you had negative cardiac enzyme markers which indicates you did not suffer an acute heart attack. Your cardiac monitoring tests (EKG, telemetry monitoring)also showed no evidence of a new heart attack. Follow up cardiac catheterization discovered that you had a narrowing of your left main coronary artery (___) which was stented and opened up to allow for better blood flow to your heart. Some of your older heart grafts were also noted to be occluded. A repeated ultrasound of your heart, called an echocardiogram, showed you still have mildly decreased heart pumping function as a result of prior heart attacks and damage to your heart muscles. Overall, however, your heart pumping function (also called ejection fraction) appears slightly better than it did in ___. . It is important that you weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight > 3 lbs. Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet per day. Also, please stop smoking. Information was given to you on admission regarding smoking cessation. . It is very important that you follow-up with your physicians as outlined below. . If you experience any additional chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, new weakness, bleeding/swelling/redness in your right groin at the catheterization entry location, or any other concerning symptoms please return to the emergency room or call your primary cardiologist as soon as possible. . MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS: -Please start taking 20mg Lasix daily for blood pressure control and for mild systolic heart dysfunction -Continue to take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets as needed and as prescribed for additional chest pains / angina -Continue taking 100mg Toprol XL once daily -Otherwise, please continue taking your usual home medications as previously prescribed . ","In summary,Mr. ___ is a ___ male with PMH significant for CABG ___, PCI ___, STEMI and subsequent VT arrest in ___ requiring additional stenting/PCI who presented with 24 hours of unstable angina. . # Chest Pains /Angina: Initially the patient's sudden onset of chest pain after ___ years of essentially no chest pains at baseline was very concerning for ACS given known premature CAD and recent graft failure. Fortunately, he had negative cardiac biomarkers. Given symptoms at rest, stent re-stenosis was felt to be less likely. Mr. ___ has a longstanding history of cardiac events, including CABG ___ (LIMA-LAD, radial PDA, SVG-OM2), PTCA and stenting to D1 in ___, and he had a STEMI/VT arrest ___ which required IABP support, and a thrombotic occlusion of SVG-OM2 was discovered and stented. At that time, back in ___, cardiac catheterization also noted 50% ostial LMCA, 50% LAD, 80% dRCA, 60% pRCA lesions and occluded LCX. On this admission, he was continued on heparin drip, and had been Plavix loaded at OSH prior to arrival in anticipation of a cardiac catheterization. He remained chest pain free after admission to ___ and he was continued on aspirin, plavix, statin therapy and Toprol XL. Repeat lipid profile showed LDLs 82, total cholesterol of 140, HDLs 36 and TGs 111. He was taken to cardiac catheterization lab and angiography revealed native 3 vessel and left main coronary artery disease. There was a patent LIMA-LAD and radial-rPDA but stump occluded at SVG-->OM3. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction noted along with some mild systemic systolic arterial hypertension as well. He underwent successful stenting of protected LMCA with a Cypher drug-eluting stent with no post-procedure complications. At time of discharge he was chest pain free with stable vital signs. He was discharged on his usual Toprol XL, statin, aspirin, plavix, SL NTG as needed and he was started on 20mg Lasix daily for blood pressure control and for mild systolic heart dysfunction. He was also advised to continue close-follow up with his primary cardiologist, Dr. ___. . . # Pump function / Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Last LVEF prior to this hospitalization was noted at 40-45%, however his history was suggestive of deterioration of systolic function with his complaints of some orthopnea, PND, and some mild bibasilar crackles on exam. Chest x-ray fairly unremarkable for any large amounts of fluid overload and read as being WNL. Team initially held off on diuresis given anticipated cardiac catheterization. Beta blocker and lisinopril continued daily. A repeat ECHO was reassuring as it showed the left ventricular ejection fraction was slightly better that his last study ___ (LVEF=40%). However, given his clinical symptoms and the notice of additional left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and mild systemic systolic arterial hypertension on cardiac catheterization he was started on Lasix 20mg daily prior to discharge alongside his usual beta-blocker and daily lisinopril. He was asked to weigh himself every morning, call MD if weight > 3 lbs, and he was also advised to adhere to 2 gm sodium diet per day. . #Rhythm: Predominantly normal sinus rhythm with no new significant ectopy noticed on continuous telemetry monitoring or serial EKGs. Heart rates typically in the 60-80s range. No subjective complaints of palpitations. . #Osteoarthritis: Predominantly in hips and knees, sometimes has ""aches"" in his lower back area as well. He was continued on his usual daily Neurontin therapy for joint aches while inpatient. . # Insomnia : Per history, it appears heart failure symptoms account for most of his sleep disturbance as he awakens secondary to PND and orthopnea. As above, his regimen was changed and Lasix added for additional CHF therapy. However, he continued on his Seroquel for now to avoid withdrawal, and given that he describes some overlapping anxiety that he feels makes his sleeping worse at night. . #Smoking: He is still smoking 1PPD, and he has been using tobacco for about ___ years. Smoking cessation counseling provided and health risks outlined clearly. He was given a Nicotine Patch 21 mg TD DAILY. . # Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: He was initially NPO in anticipation of cardiac catheterization but ___ placed on a regular cardiac healthy diet post-procedure. Electrolytes were monitored and repleted daily as needed. . # Prophylaxis: He was continued on a heparin drip which also served as DVT protection, and Colace/Senna given PRN for bowel regimen. . # Code Status: The patient was maintained as a full code status for the entirety of his hospital course. .

Medications: metoprolol 25 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg QD, isordil dinitrite 10 mg TID, rosuvastatin 40 mg QD clopidogrel 75 mg QD Type of stress/symptoms: The patient had no symptoms at rest/prior to stress. The patient exercised on a Gervino treadmill (3 min stages) protocol for 13 min 0 sec ___ METS) representing a fair exercise capacity for age and gender. The test was stopped due to claudication and leg fatigue. In response to stress, the patient had ___ left shoulder pain beginning at 12.5 min of exercise (heart rate 106bpm; systolic blood pressure 188mmHg)that resolved at 3.0 min (heart rate 83bpm; systolic blood pressure (152mmHg) of recovery. Hemodynamics: In response to stress, the heart rate increased to 109 bpm (65 % APMHR) with a peak systolic blood pressure of 188 mmHg (peak rate-pressure product = ___. ECG: The resting ECG showed sinus rhythm and non-specific STT wave changes. The stress ECG showed showed no change from baseline at peak exercise. More pronounced biphasic T waves were noted in recovery. During stress there was one isolated ventricular premature beats. Rest echo: Resting echo images demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is normal regional left ventricular systolic function and normal global systolic function. Diastolic parameters are indeterminate. The right ventricular cavity size is normal with normal free wall motion. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrates no aortic valve stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation and no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. The resting estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. Stress echo: Echo images were acquired within 54 sec post stress at heart rates of 105 to 93 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments. The E/e' was 13 at seconds after exercise and similar to baseline. This suggests no abnormal increase in left ventricular filling pressure with exercise. There was appropriate augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. Exercise conclusion: Fair functional exercise capacity for age and gender. Non-specific ECG changes, with anginal pain, and no 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved treadmill stress. No Doppler evidence for a change in left ventricular filling pressure with exercise.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? -========= - You were admitted because you had chest pain in the setting of recently placed stents one week ago. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? -- - You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest pain. Based on our evaluation, there was no indication that you had a heart attack. During an exercise stress test, you had anginal chest pain, so the decision was made to proceed with a coronary angiogram to look at the coronary arteries. Based on the findings, the recommendation was made to manage your coronary artery disease and chest pain with medications. You were started on a new medication called Imdur to help with the chest pain, and your dose of Lisinopril was decreased from 10 mg daily to 5 mg daily. WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? --== - It is very important to take your aspirin and clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) every day. These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot forming in your heart stents and having another heart attack. Please do not stop taking either medication without talking to your heart doctor. - You are also on other medications to help your heart: Rosuvastatin, Metoprolol, Imdur, and Lisinopril. Make sure to take these and all your other medications exactly as prescribed. - If you have severe anginal chest pain that does not improve with rest, your daily Imdur, and sublingual nitroglycerin, please go to the emergency department. - Continue to not smoke cigarettes, as cigarettes significantly increase your risk of coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and stroke. By quitting, you have decreased your risk of experiencing such events in the future. Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish you all the best!

Atrial Fibrillation 5. Diabetes Mellitus 6. Hypertension 7. COPD <DISCHARGE CONDITION> good <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted with chest pain. Given your history of coronary artery disease and episodes of chest pain similar to the one you experienced just prior to this admission, we decided a cardiac catheterization would be appropriate. The catheterization showed that the grafted vessels that were constructed during your prior bypass surgery were open, meaning there was no new blockage causing your symptoms. However, it's still important that you continue your usual medications, including your beta blocker, statin, ace inhibitor, aspirin, plavix, and blood pressure medications. ","___ female with complex cardiac history with multiple interventions presenting with angina. . 1. CORONARIES: Her presenting symptoms were concerning for unstable angina. The patient proceed to catheterization on ___. Given her creatinine elevation at 1.5 at time of admission, we prehydrated her along with sodium bicarbonate and N-acetylcysteine. In the holding area, just prior to catheterization, the patient developed some respiratory distress, with O2 sats dropping to low 80 % on 2 L O2. She was re-started on IV heparin, a nitroglycerin drip, and received IV lasix, with only 100 ccs of urine output. Her O2 saturation improved after received a nebulizer treatment. Cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed vein grafts to be patent and no intervention was performed. LVEDP was mildly elevated at 15 - 20 mm Hg. Medical management was encouraged. During the hospitalization, the patient had multiple episodes of chest pain following cardiac catheterization, resolving within minutes after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. It's likely that the patient will continue to have these episodes and will need to use nitroglycerin as needed. We continued her on aspirin, statin, plavix, beta blocker, and ACEI. . 2. Congestive Heart Failure The patient was volume overloaded during the majority of the hospitalization. This is likely because on admission, we decreased the patient's home regimen of torsemide from 20 mg TID to 20 mg BID because of the creatinine elevation, as well as prehydrating her with 1 L before catheterization. On exam, she had rales and 1+ pitting edema, and required 2 L of oxygen to maintain saturations in the ___. We attempted multiple diuretic regimens, including using furosemide, metolazone, and torsemide. She had very little output following furosemide. The most effective was 5 mg of metolazone followed by 60 mg of torsemide. Towards the end of hospitalization, she developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to overdiuresis, and her torsemide was held for two days while her creatinine resolved. By the end of hospitalization, her rales had improved considerably, her pitting edema resolved, and she was able to saturate normally on room air. On ambulation, she was saturating at 97% on RA. She was discharged on 20 mg of torsemide PO BID. . 3. Acute Renal Failure As a consequence of diuresis and possibly contrast dye, the patient's creatinine rose from baseline to 2.3. We stopped her torsemide regimen and encouraged PO intake of fluids. Towards the end of hospitalization, her creatinine trended back down to baseline. She was restarted on torsemide twice a day. She will have her creatinine checked within 1 wk outpatient. . 4. Atrial Fibrillation Near the end of hospitalization, probably as a consequence of diuresis and likely volume depletion along with renal failure, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with HR 100 - 140. Her BP at the time was stable at 102/70. She received PO metoprolol with conversion back into sinus rhythm. She was symptomatic with chest pressure at the time of atrial fibrillation; she received a nitroglycerin with resolution of this pain. We increased her home metoprolol dose from 37.5 mg PO BID to 50 mg PO BID. She remained in normal sinus rhythm. . 5. Type II Diabetes Mellitus The patient's sugars were difficult to control throughout hospitalization. Initially, metformin and glyburide were held due to creatinine elevation. She was maintained on a sliding scale. However, when sugars started to > 400 regularly, she was restarted on glyburide at half her normal dose. Lantus was started at night in addition and metformin continued being held. The combination of 8 U lantus at night and glyburide along with sliding scale provided her good coverage. As her creatinine trended back down, we restarted her on metformin and her home dose of glyburide. . 6. COPD We continued her advair and spiriva and her albuterol as needed. Was stable during hospitalization. . 7. GERD We continued her H2 blocker. . 8. Dispo: The patient was discharged to home with home O2. She was transported by ambulance given her oxygen requirement. We set her up with ___ services. ",2892,989,14

The LAD had a 50% proximal, 100% mid after the origin of a ___ large diagonal branch. The distal LAD was very small with diffuse disease. The LCX had a 80% proximal stenosis prior to a large OMB. The RCA had a 50-60% mid stenosis. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a left ventricular enddiastolic pressure of 35 mmHg. The mean systemic arterial pressure was 110 mmHg (phasic 143/95 mmHg). 3. Successful manual aspiration thrombectomy, PTCA and placement of a 2.5x23mm Cypher stent were performed in the mid-LAD. The stent was post-dilated using a 2.75mm diameter balloon. Final angiography showed normal flow, no appparent dissection, and no residual in-stent stenosis. (See ___ comments.) 4. Intravascular ultrasound of the mid-LAD following the PCI showed a minimum cross-sectional area of 4.5 mm2 in the LAD just proximal to the placed stent. 5. The right common femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using a Perclose device. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. 3. Stage I systemic arterial hypertension. 4. Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LAD was performed. ECHO The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal septum, and distal left ventricular segments/apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral valve leaflets are normal with trivial regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

Selctive coronary angiography of this right dominant coronary circulation demonstrated native 3 vessel disease. The LMCA was free of angiographically significant stenosis. There was a 60% stenosis in the proximal LAD. The first diagonal branch was totally occluded. The LCX was a small vessel with diffuse disease that gave rise to a very small OM1. A much larger OM2 was totally occluded. The RCA was totally occluded in its mid segment. 2. Venous conduit arteriography demonstrated a SVG to OM2 that was free of angiographically significant disease. A second SVG to the R-PDA was 90% occluded in its mid segment by thrombus. There was competative flow to the antegrade limb. 3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a 60% stenosis in the mid segment of a LIMA graft to a large D1 at the site of a kink in the vessel. 4. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right heart filling pressures (RVEDP=30mmHg and LVEDP=28mmHg). There was near equalization of diastolic pressures. There was no evidence of ventricular interdependence with simultaneous RV and LV tracings to suggest constrictive disease. A restrictive process is possible. There was no clear evidence of a pulsus paradoxus within the limits imposed by his atrial fibrillation. The cardiac index was preserved (CI=2.1L/min/m2). There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic hypertension (SBP=46mmHg and DBP=33mmHg). Systemic arterial pressures were normal. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Acute myocaridal infarction with thrombus in the SVG -> R-PDA graft. The patient became very uncomfortable during the procedure and PCI could not be pursued safely. He understood the risks of this and chose to return for PCI the following day. The patient should be maintained on plavix and heparin pending repeat catheterization. 3. Severely elevated right and left heart filling pressures. This may be explained by volume overload and diastolic dysfunction, but restrictive/constrictive process should be considered. There was no interventricular independence. He should undergo dialysis and an echocardiogram should be obtained. . ___ EKG Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, new as compared with prior tracing of ___. There is low limb lead voltage. Evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction. Cannot exclude prior anterior wall myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is variation in precordial lead placement. However, the lateral ST segment depression is more prominent. The Q-T interval remains prolonged. Clinical correlation is suggested. . ___ ECHO The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe hypokinesis of the interolateral, inferior, and septal walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened (?fusion of left and non-coronary leaflets which are relatively immobile). There is minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta. Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of ___, the left ventricular cavity is now smaller with more extensive regional dysfunction now involving the septum and right ventricular free wall. The other findings are similar. The rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has mild aortic stenosis. Based on ___ ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ years. The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or ___. Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data. . ___ CXR INDICATION: Recent below knee amputation, coronary artery disease, and bypass grafting, shortness of breath. Evaluate for edema. FINDINGS: Comparison with radiographs dated ___ indicates resolution of the small right pleural effusion and stable moderately severe cardiomegaly on a background of bypass grafting. IMPRESSION: Moderately severe cardiomegaly is stable since ___. No radiographic evidence of acute pulmonary edema. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Tel ___ to pharmacy home meds Confirmed on: Metoprolol succinate 150mg qd Lisinopril 40mg qd Furosemide 20g qd Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg qd Fluoxetine 40mg qd Amlodipine 10mg qd Clonidine 100mcg bid Clopidogrel 75mg qd Glargine 20u at night' Sevelamer Simvastatin 40mg qd Aspirin 81mg qd <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

You were brought to the hospital because of shortness of breath which you experienced at home. During your hospitalization you had several tests done which ruled out a lung clot. However you were found to have a clot in one of your CABG vein grafts on your heart. This clot was cleared by cardiac catherization, where two stents were placed in this area. Another test also revealed your heart is not pumping as affectively as it should. We feel like your shortness of breath is therefore caused by disease in your heart which is also causing fluid to collect in your lungs. Your weight prior to leaving was 190 pounds. It is essential you weigh yourself every morning, call your primary care doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. So, you should call your doctor if you weigh more than 193 pounds. You should continue the following medications with the following important changes: 1. DECREASE Lantus to 16 units daily as your blood sugars were quite low on your previous 23 units daily. 2. STOP: Isorsorbide Mononitrate as you had no evidence of chest pain after your procedure. 3. STOP: Amlodipine 4. STOP: Clonidine 5. STOP Furosemide 6. CONTINUE: Sevelmer 2400 mg with meals 7. CONTINUE: Nephrocaps, 1 capsule daily ****Your kidney doctors ___ monitor your blood pressure in dialysis and re-adjust your blood pressure regimen as needed. You did not have high blood pressure in the hospital, so we did not re-start some of your home medications.**** ****It is very important you remain compliant with your medications*** ***It is very important that you keep all of your doctor's apointments.*** ","___ male with multiple medical problems including chronic systolic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrilliation(age unknown, thought to be in last 2 ___ triple vessel CABG, ESRD ,DM, HTN and peripheral vascular disease presenting with worsening dyspnea over the last 6 weeks and with acute episode SOB on ___ which required hospitalization at ___ transferred to BID for NSTEMI cardiac catherization. . # NSTEMI- He denied any chest pain but had a prolonged history of SOB. ECG showed an old inferior infarct and seemingly new lateral ST depression. At ___ they ruled in for NSTEMI and was started on a heparin drip, plavix, lipitor, and metoprolol and serial ECGs were taken. His troponin increased from 0.23 to to 1.14 and peaked at 2.09 on ___. Echo showed left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD and new changes included a smaller left ventricular cavity with more extensive regional dysfunction now involving the septum and right ventricular free wall. Cardiac catherization on ___ showed venous conduit arteriography demonstrated a SVG to OM2 that was free of angiographically significant disease. A second SVG to the R-PDA was 90% occluded in its mid segment by thrombus. There was competative flow to the anterograde limb. Furthermore arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a 60% stenosis in the mid segment of a LIMA graft to a large D1 at the site of a kink in the vessel. It was felt that his occluded PDA should be targeted and at a second caridac catherization (___) he had 2 BMS placed in his second SVG to the R-PDA. Post-procedure, he was initially managed with an IV heparin infusion and this was later changed to s/c for DVT prophylaxis. We continued Atorvastatin, Aspirin and Clopidogrel. Lipid panel showed a LDL 35 HDL 34. Commenced Metoprolol for rate control. . # Chronic systolic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction- Most probably ischemic in nature given his extensive CAD disease. 6 weeks dyspnea prior to admission was felkt likely due to exacerbation of congestive cardiac failure in the context of new AF. His most recent cath showed near equalization of diastolic pressures with o obvious signs suggestive of constrictive disease. A restrictive process is still possible, however there was no clear evidence of a pulsus paradoxus within the limits imposed by his atrial fibrillation, and overall it was felt that these findings were consistent with potential constrictive/restrictive pericardial process which could be affecting his heart function. His EF was depressed at 35-40%. There were minimal valvular abnormalities but there was evidence of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a dilated thoracic aorta. A CXR on ___ showed moderately severe cardiomegaly but no radiographic evidence of acute pulmonary edema following dialysis. He continued in AF and it was not deemed safe to warfarinise due to falls risk and it was felt that cardioversion would likely not be successful if attempted. He was diuresed with good urine output and Metoprolol and Lisinopril were started . His shortness of breath improved and he was discharged home. . # Atrial Fibrilliation- The patient's first documentated case is ___, his EKG before that on ___ showed normal sinus rhythm. Possible causes include thyroid disease but his TSH was normal, PE was ruled out with a negative CTA at ___ and it was felt that this was likely secondary to his left atrial enlargement. ___ score is 3 points.TSH was normal. He was started on Metoprolol for rate control. He qualified for coumadin however due to falls risk and medication compliance issues the decision was made not to start warfarin. Cardioversion was considered but it was felt that given his left and right atrial enlargement that the chances of success would be low. His AF is rate-controlled with Metoprolol. . # ESRD- ___ year history, felt likely secondary to hypertension and DM. At ___, he was was given insulin and kayexalate for hyperkalemia.At ___, we continued his dialysis regimen with a UF goal of 3.5L and this improved his cardiac failure. We continued renagel, sevelamer and ferrous sulfate. . #Possible Bacteremia- Positive blood cultures set from ___ at ___ which showed gram positive cocci in clusters and was started on Vancomycin. He remained afebrile with no signs of infections. Infectious diseases at ___ suggested 3 more doses of Vancomycin 1 gram after each hemodialysis session for next 3 times.After reviewing the records only ___ bottles grew gram positive cocci in clusters on ___ discontinued Vancomycin regimen given the absence of any clinical signs of infection.Blood cultures taken on ___ and ___, have no growth to date. These should be followed up. . #Metabolic Acidosis- According to our records, the ABG's done at ___ and the current labs in house showed a increased anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.Possible etiologies include uremia. The patient is currently recieving dialysis three times a week, with the last being on ___. Salicylate toxicity remains unlikely after speaking with the patient.We touched base with renal about dialysis regimen as it seems to have recently been inadequate, renal has been made aware of this and felt like his current regimen is adequate. They do suspect thar he has not been compliant with his medications given his short term memory issues and that this may be intefering with his fluid status. . # Type 2 Diabetes- Adjusted Insulin SC with 16 units lantus at ___. . # Potential Dementia/ Depression- has exhibited more short term memory loss according to his family since his wife died 6 months ago. This appears to be a more chronic progressive dementia taht has now been picked up in the context of his wife's death and him not being able to hide his symptoms. During this admission he has exhibited mild confusion at times at night, when he forgets why he is in the hospital but will still remain oriented to time and place in these episodes. Continued home dose Fluoxetine. Lorazepam PRN was given for anxiety. Mini Mental on ___ was ___ with significant impairment in short-term memory. . #Hypertension Held BP meds amlodipine, Imdur, clonidine. Given systolic blood pressures in 90'-120, BP currently being well controlled with metoprolol and lisinopril. ",5893,1415,14

Given acute onset of symptoms, she was admitted for stroke workup. ED COURSE: In the ED, a code stroke was called. NIHSS 1 for L sided sensory loss to pin prick. tPA was not administered given minimal symptoms and that she was >3 hours from last known normal state. Vital signs were stable. Her exam was notable for decreased strength (4+/5) of the left interphalangeal, hamstring, and tibialis anterior muscles. She had decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch on her LLE. A non-contrast head CT showed no intracranial abnormalities. She had a normal ECG, chest X-ray, and an MRI which showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. Her lab work was significant for CBC WNL, chem 7 WNL with her BUN/creatinine (40/2.1) at baseline. Nml coags, LFTs, lipids, serum tox. HbA1c was 8.1, TSH was 1.3, LDL 45. She was transferred to the floor for further work-up and monitoring. HOSPITAL COURSE: Her exam on the floor was notable for new left-sided dysmetria on finger-to-nose test as well as mild left-sided weakness and sensory deficits, which improved by hospital day 3. Our impression that her presentation was due to an MRI-negative lacunar stroke resulting in ataxic hemiparesis. Her echocardiogram was unremarkable. Her hospital course was complicated by hyperglycemia; her insulin regimen was adjusted after the ___ was consulted, and her fingersticks improved. On hospital day 3, Ms. ___ had an isolated fever to 101.6, and her WBC count rose to 13.4 from 9.0. UA was negative for nitrites, WBC 1, but showed 100 protein and glucose. Urine and blood cultures were drawn. A repeat chest X-ray was negative. Her temperature then fell to normal range the rest of her hospital course, and her WBC count the next day fell to 8.2. Also, on hospital day 3, her creatinine rose from 2.2--> 3.3 and BUN from 46-->77-->82. This was thought to be prerenal ___ due to decreased PO intake due to nausea in the setting of hyperglycemia. Her PO intake improved as her nausea subsided, her urine output improved, and her creatinine and BUN were downtrending on discharge. The patient was seen by ___, who felt that she would be stable for home discharge within ___ ___ visits in hospital, with home ___ and ___ services. Transitional issues: 1. She has had longstanding orthostatic hypotension, which we have documented here. 2. Follow-up creatinine ___ on CKD, improving) 3.

Once extubated ___ reported baseline may be closer to 2.6. ___ with known L atrophic kidney with stenting for renal artery stenosis. Some consideration was given to whether stent thrombosis could explain atrophic kidney and hypertension. On review of old records it seems that kidney was atrophic even prior to stenting so this may not be a change. Also, renal artery stenosis cannot fully explain elevated creatinine as he should still have normal creatinine with a single kidney. Given CKD, cardiac catheterization was performed with only a minimal amount of intravenous contrast. Renal ultrasound showed left kidney 7.9 cm as above. His creatinine on discharge was 2.8 after peaking at 3 post cath dye load. He had instructions and a prescription to get BUN, Cr, and potassium checked on ___. . # HTN: BP well controlled on home toprol and nifedipine CR. . #. h/o myalgias - ___ with history of myalgias, even unrelated to statin intolerance. ESR elevated at 80. Rheumatology saw him and believed the presentation to be consistent with PVD, the he also has upper extremity pain/weakness. ESR was considered of uncertain significance. . # chronic anemia - ___ with low Fe and ferritin on Fe studies. No evidence of bleeding/bruising. This may be in part due to his kidney disease +/- iron deficiency. He was on FeSO4 as an outpatient and was discharged on his home regimen. . # FEN: Cardiac diet . # Prophylaxis: heparin SC initially ordered but ___ refused.

He had received this care in ___, where he lives with his wife. He most recently completed a marathon two months ago without chest pain. . Mr. ___ was running the ___ Marathon today, with his son, without having taken his ASA and Plavix for the last two days. His doctor had previously told him to hold these for two days prior to racing to reduce bruising. He got to mile 25 before witnessed callapse, earlier increasing shortness of breath and fatigue, followed by loss of consciousness. Bystander provided CPR until AED arrived. No strips, but AED determined shockable rhythm, likely VF. Sinus rhythm was re-established after two shocks and he was brought to ___ and directly into the cath lab. En route he received 100 mg lidocaine. In the ED he was noted to have ST elevation in V3 with biphasic t-waves. ST depression was also commented upon there. Code STEMI was called. He received Integrillin, IVFs (~ 2L), ASA 325 mg, Plavix (loaded with 600 mg), vitals were 151/87, HR 86, RR 23, 97% NC. Cardiology was consulted and recommended direct transfer to the cath. lab. On coronary agiography, LCx stent was appreciated and open, LAD disease was noted ~ 90%. Unlikely STEMI, infact unlikely ACS, but Dr. ___ describes as likely angina/ischemia with consequent VF and arrest. Possible that ischemic changes on EKG are secondary to demand and shocks. A long stent drug-eluting stent was placed in the LAD. He received 20 mg IV Lasix. EKG had partly normalized after cath. .

You were admitted for cardiac arrest, or failure of your heart to beat. You were rescued with CPR and shocked, which restored your heart rhythm and saved your life. You were then brought to the ___ for further management, where you went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In the lab they found that the left anterior descending or LAD artery was 90% blocked. A long drug eluting stent was placed to keep the artery open. You underwent an echocardiogram which showed mild to moderate reduction of your heart function. This may be temporary or permanent, it will become clear once you repeat an echocardiogram or ultrasound in your heart in about a month. We also obtained a cardiac MRI to be sure that there was no other cause of the cardiac arrest other than the 90% blocked LAD artery, which was confirmed to be correct according to the MRI. Now that this blockage was corrected, your chances of another cardiac arrest will be very low. . Medication changes: 1. You will need to take a full dose aspirin and Plavix every day for at least one year and possibly longer. Do not stop taking Plavix or Aspirin or miss any doses unless Dr. ___ ___ says that it is OK. You risk having heart attack if you stop these medicines. 2. Start Atorvastatin (Lipitor) to lower your cholesterol and help your heart recover. 3. Start Metoprolol daily to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover 4. Start Lisinopril daily to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover. ","# Coronary Artery Disease/v fib arrest: The patient had previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease with a stent placed to the left circumflex in ___. Rhythm strips obtained from the AED in the field after his fall showed ventricular fibrillation prior to shocking the patient back into normal sinus rhythm. He was brought to ___ where he underwent cardiac catheterization. This revealed two vessel disease with long diffuse disease in the mid LAD with 90% stenosis and 80% stenosis of a small PL branch from the RCA. The LMCA did not have disease and the left circumflex stent was widely patent. The patient received a 3.0 x 33mm Cypher drug eluting stent to the LAD without complications. It was thought that the cause of his ventricular fibrilation was due to ischemia in the LAD distribution from increased demand during the marathon. He had an echo which showed mild regional left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with mid LAD disease and impaired left ventricular relaxation. His EF was 40-45%. Previous records were obtained which showed in ___ the patient had an LVEF of 60% on echo and no perfusion defects on nuclear ETT, indicating an interval insult to the LAD, which most likely was from an ischemic event during the marathon. The patient had a cardiac MRI to rule out any other areas of cardiac abnormalities that may have contributed to the arrhythmia. The final report is pending, but the preliminary report showed subendocardial gadolinium uptake in the LAD territory which was likely from his recent ischemic event. There were no other abnormalities. Therefore it was decided that an ICD for secondary prevention was not indicated in this patient. He was started on aspirin 325 mg, plavix 75mg, and atorvastain 80 mg, as well as metoprolol 12.5 mg TID. He tolerated this well and was discharged on metoprolol succinate 50 mg Q day. He was also started on lisinopril 5 mg for the decreased ejection fraction and anterior MI. He should continue on this medication and have his electrolytes checked in one week. He was instructed to decrease his physical activity, mainly his running, over the next month and undergo an exercise stress test at that time before resuming more vigorous running. He will see his cardiologist in ___ in 1 - 2 weeks when he returns home. He should remain on his plavix for at least ___ year and his aspirin indefinitely. # coping: The patient exprtessed disappointment in not finishing the race and dealing with his diagnosis of myocardial infarction. He was visited by social work to provide support. # Hypercholesterolemia Total cholesterol was previously noted to be 194, per the patient, but he was not taking a statin. Labs show presently his LDL is 98 and t cholesterol is 182. He was discharged on 80 mg atorvastatin a day. # Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with a creatinine of 1.5. This was thought to be pre-renal from his marathon. His creatinine was trended and was 0.9 the day of discharge. # Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with a white count of 13.3. This resolved over the next to days and was likley from the stress of the marathon and cardiac arest. His white count was 6.3 at discharge. # Mental Status: The patient's family noted some subtle changes in his short-term memory. Over time this seemed to have improved. The patient denied any defecits in memory. ",3058,763,13

It resolves upon rest at times and sometimes with more gradual increase of activities. The chest pain usually lasts about 3 minutes. He had a nuclear stress test done in ___ during which he did 9 mins of ___, with ___ METS (excellent) and was found to have reversible flow in OM1 region. He deferred cath at the time and it was decided he would have medical management. However, on ___, 2 days prior to admission, patient was out camping. He woke up with a mild dull sub-sternal chest pain, about ___, non-radiating. He denies any SOB, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and diaphoresis. He initially attributed it to sleeping on damp ground overnight. However, this persisted. He went to ___ in ___ where an AMI work up was done and lab studies (troponin, EKG) were negative, per patient. On the day of admission, he called Dr. ___ the persistent CP which he thinks is similar to his acute heart attack in the past, and he was referred to come into the ED.

Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA showed a 25% ostial lesion. The LAD had a proximal Bard stent with 25% tubular in stent restensosis; mild disease mid LAD 35% at D4; distal LAD is somewhat small in caliber with slow flow consistent with microvascular; high D1 (arising before Bard stent) with mild diffuse disease. The LCx had focal heavy calcification; ostial 20%; AV groove Cx absent after atrial branches and modest caliber OM1. The RCA showed proximal 20%; patent stent proximal-mid RCA with 30% distal edge stenosis; mild in-stent restenosis distal RCA; 50% slightly hazy difficult to visualize stenosis in the distal RCA spanning the origin of the twin RPDA and extending just beyond into the distal AV groove RCA; more rightward RPDA is smaller than the ___ larger RDPA; the ___ RPDA is diffusely diseased to 35%; mild diffuse in-stent restenosis in distal AV groove RCA leading to large RPL2, with jailed very distal AV groove RCA supplying small RPL3 and modest long RPL4; AM1 mid 50%; RPL2 50%.

Rx Radi pressure wire equalized at 10 atm Hg abd delivered after some effort into RPL2. baseline Pd/Pa 0.94 with 6 mm hg gradient with the guiding catheter disengaged from RCA. With the maximal hyperemia induced by IV adenosine, the FFR was 0.71. Upon pullback of the transducer into the distal RCA before the RPDA, the FFR was 0.93. Upon pullback of the transducer into the guiding catheter, FFR was 1.00. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Moderate single vessel coronary artery disease with mild diffuse in stent restenosis. 2. Normal LV disastolic function. 3. Positive pressure wire of the complex stenosis in the ___ RCA spanning the origins of both RPDAs. 4. Findings discussed with Dr. ___.

You underwent cardiac catheterization on ___, during which no additional intervention was performed due to the anatomy of your right coronary artery. Therefore, your coronary artery disease was managed medically with some medication changes. Please note the following changes to your medication: - Please START rosuvastatin (Crestor) 10 mg, 1 tab, by mouth, once at bed time. - Please START lisinopril 10 mg, 1 tab, by mouth, once daily. - Please DECREASE aspirin to 81 mg, 1 tab, by mouth, once daily. - You can STOP taking plavix 75 mg, 1 tab, by mouth, once daily. Please follow up with your primary care physician and your cardiologist. ","He was admitted on ___ for persistent chest pain and discharged on ___. 1. Unstable Angina, secondary to coronary artery disease. Given the change in his chest pain from exertional to rest chest pain a few days prior to admission and his significant coronary artery disease, patient underwent cardiac catheterization. However, due to his RCA anatomy, no additional stent was placed. Amlodipine was considered but it was thought that his HR was already borderline low and lisinopril was just added during this hospitalization. This could be reconsidered later. Plavix was held during hospitalization given his significant history of epistaxis and reluctance. However, the medical team had a discussion with patient regarding the benefit and risk of being on Plavix. He understands and prefers to take the lower dosage as he had been prior to admission. It is advised that he discuss with his cardiologist regarding the use of Plavix. His unstable angina and coronary disease was optimized medically with metoprolol, lisinopril, rosuvastatin (given myalgia from pravastatin), aspirin (as agreed by patient), and prn SL nitroglycerin prior to discharge. He will need to follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist. 2. Severe mixed dyslipidemia. This has been a chronic issue for him per outpatient record. He had been on pravastatin but self-discontinued for myalgia few days prior to admission, despite normal CK. His goal LDL should be < 70 given his coronary artery disease, and he is still not at goal. A discussion was carried out with patient regarding rosuvastatin, its potency, and potentially less myalgic profile with the lipophilic property. He agreed with the plan. This should be followed up by his primary care physician and cardiologist. 3. Hypertension. Patient had mildly elevated SBP in the 140s during this admission. 10 mg of lisinopril was initiated for better blood pressure in additional to metoprolol. Metoprolol was not up-titrated given mild sinus bradycardia on home dose.

The pulmonary arterial trunk is of normal caliber. There is no filling defect down the subsegmental level. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. Calcified atherosclerotic disease is seen in the coronary arteries. Additionally, abnormal calcification is seen in the chordae tendineae of the left ventricle along with hypodensity in the inferior left ventricular wall may represent prior NSTEMI. The lungs are clear with mild bibasilar atelectasis. While this exam is not specifically designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the superior pole of right kidney demonstrates a 6 cm hypodensity that is incompletely characterized but may represent a simple cyst. No comparison is available at the time of dictation. BONES: Moderate degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine, primarily in the form of prominent anterior osteophytes. No aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute aortic syndrome or PE. 2. Cardiac findings suggesting prior inferior wall NSTEMI. . # TTE ___ at 11: 46: 49 AM): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

You initially went to ___ after an episode of low blood pressure and near-fainting. They were concerned that you were having a heart attack and sent you to ___ for catheterization. This procedure showed no new blockage in your cardiac arteries or prior stents. You were noted to have a urinary tract infection. It is likely that your symptoms were due to this infection causing you to have low blood pressure. After discussion with your Urologist, we started antibiotics for this infection. You should follow-up with Dr ___ week. While you were in the hospital, your blood sugar was very high. You should follow-up with your primary care physician to start insulin and ensure your diabetes is under good control. We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP cyclobenzaprine, which you were not using - START senna and colace to keep your stool soft and regular while recovering from your procedure - START Cipro, an antibiotic, for 5 days (___) - START Nicotine Patch to help quit smoking Please follow up with your primary care physician, ___, and urologist as listed below. Remember, never stop your Plavix or aspirin without first talking to your cardiologist. ","___ with Hx CAD s/p stenting to the ostial and mid LAD in ___, LCx in ___, and OM in ___, known total occlusion of the RCA, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and current tobacco use who presented with nausea, vomiting, and weakness with new lower abdominal pain, found to have elevated tropI, now s/p cath with no new stenosis. . # CORONARIES / type II MI: History of 3VD on cath in ___, R dominant with diffuse LAD, totally occluded RCA. s/p OM1 stent in ___, DES to LCx in ___, DES to mid-LAD and DES to ostium/proximal LAD in ___. Cardiac cath ___ showed no new stenosis. This appeared to be a type 2 MI (NSTEMI), with decreased blood supply due to hypotension and hypovolemia. This was most likely ___ nausea and vomiting and/or UTI. TropT the morning following admission was 0.20, down from tropI at OSH 0.57 (although these are not directly comparable measurements). The patient was already on appropriate medical management with aspirin, statin, metoprolol, ACE inhibitor, and nitrate. These were continued. Cholesterol panel showed good control with LDL < 50. Following discussion with the patient's Urology office, Plavix was restarted. # PUMP: No history of CHF, LVEF preserved in ___ despite multiple MIs. TTE on this admission showed LVEF 45-50% with increased wall motion abnormalities. # RHYTHM: No history of Afib or arrhythmia, none seen on telemetry during this admission. # HLD: Continued statin. Cholesterol panel showed good control. # Hypotension: Hypertensive at baseline with multiple medications, presented with hypotension, which is the likely cause of his presyncope and ischemia. This could be due to poor PO intake in the 3 days prior to admission due to nausea and vomiting. Medications were initially held due to hypotension, then restarted successfully with good SBP control. # BPH, recurrent cystitis one week s/p TURP, UTI: Patient complained of suprapubic tenderness, although his post-operative hematuria had resolved. Denied urinary symptoms, had substantially reduced frequency. UA showed sign of infection, which may be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Terazosin was continued and Cipro started for UTI per Urology input. On one measurement, the patient had a post-void residual of 570cc, but then had good output that resolved this transient retention. Urology follow-up appointment already in place, documented for patient. # T2DM: FSBS elevated at ___ and here up to 300-450. The patient did not develop an anion gap acidosis, but clearly was not in good control. Oral agents were held in favor of ISS. This was uptitrated several times and Lantus added for basal control. As the patient's PCP is in the midst of adjusting his outpatient regimen, no changes were made on discharge. Inactive Issues: # Nausea/vomiting: Patient presented with history of nausea and vomiting 3 days PTA, may be ___ UTI. No symptoms during admission. # COPD: continued inhalers (albuterol and Advair) # Tobacco abuse: prefers not to use patch; encouraged to do so prior to discharge to aid smoking cessation. Prescription provided. # Back pain: not currently active, does not use cyclobenzaprine or other medication CODE: FULL EMERGENCY CONTACT: ___ (wife, ___ Transitional Issues: - Consider switching statin given the 80mg dose of simvastatin is now discouraged; the patient has been on this dose for more than a year, so its use is reasonable - We restarted Plavix; ensure this is not held without Cardiology input - The patient was started on Cipro for UTI, but sensitivity information was still pending at the time of discharge. It would be helpful to follow-up to ensure that this is appropriate treatment. - Provided Rx for nicotine patch to aid in smoking cessation ",4264,882,13

The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex, with focal apical dyskinesis; the lateral wall appears hypokinetic as well. There is relative preservation of inferior posterior wall contractile function. There is no obvious ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. . Lower Extremity Ultra Sound INDICATION: Recent myocardial infarction and sinus tachycardia with question of deep venous thrombosis. . FINDINGS: Waveforms of the common femoral veins are symmetric bilaterally with appropriate responses to Valsalva maneuvers. In the right lower extremity, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous, superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal with compressibility, wall-to-wall flow on color Doppler analysis and response to waveform augmentation. Wall-to-wall flow is also seen in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins in the right calf. . In the left lower extremity, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous veins are normal with appropriate compressibility and wall-to-wall flow on color Doppler analysis. Isoechoic material is seen within the femoral vein, which is incompletely compressible and shows only partial flow on color Doppler analysis, consistent with SFV deep venous thrombosis. Wall-to-wall flow is seen in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins on the left. A small echogenic focus seen along the anterior margin of the left common femoral artery, is likely related to an arterial closure device from previous endovascular procedure. . IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive DVT in the left femoral vein. . Radiographic Imaging: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of any other chest imaging: . Heart is mildly enlarged. Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung could be pneumonia, accompanied by small left pleural effusion. Right lung is clear and there is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.

The following medication changes were made: ADDED: Aspirin, Plavix, Diltiazem, Lasix, Lovenox, Warfarin, cefodoxime, nitroglycerin, atorvastatin CHANGED: None STOPPED: Hydrochlorathiazide, simvastatin, flonase, sudafed Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. ","___ year old male with h/o DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia who presented to OSH with a STEMI who was transferred to ___ with ECG concerning for STEMI and fever who was subsequently diagnosed with a PE/DVT, PNA, pericarditis, STEMI and an SVT/Atrial Tachycardia. . Summary & Formulation: # s/p STEMI: The patient presented to ___ for an intervention for a known LAD lesion, after having chest pain for several days. The OSH did not send the patient to the Cath lab immediately after presentation as they believed that the infarct had occured several days prior to his prsentation to the OSH ED. He was medically managed for two days over the holiday weekend prior to having a catheterization, and then transferred for an intervention. He had a ___ placed to the mid LAD, and was subsequently chest pain free. He had an ECHO which demonstrated an EF 25% with a dilated left ventricle and severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex, with focal apical dyskinesis; the lateral wall appears hypokinetic as well. He was continued on plavix, aspirin, and atorvastatin. His ECHO was also suggestive of Pericarditis which was confirmed with a rub on physical exam. . # Asthma exacerbation: He presented with out complaints of SOB, but he continued to require his albuterol inhaler. His heart rate was noted to be high, and he had a peak flow in the 200's. He was also given Metoprolol to help control his HR to reduce the risk of adverse remodeling ___. However, his breathing continued to worsen, and he began to require O2. His beta-blocker was stopped and his peak flow was measured to be 200. He was started on his Flovent inhaler, and continued on ipratropium nebulizers. He was not started on steroids for an asthma exacerbation due to concern that it would precipitate a ventricular aneurysm or septal rupture. His peak flow prior to discharge was 425. . # SVT: The patient had three runs of SVT of 220. He report symptoms of flushing, but was never hypotensive or unresponsive. He only noted flushing on the second and third round of SVT. The rhythm was noted to be accelerated, and the DDx included AT, MAT, versus AVNRT. The latter was thought to be unlikely, with AT as the most likely diagnosis. He was treated with IV diltiazem to break the episodes of SVT and then started on a low dose diltiazem which was 60 mg QID. We had tried 30 mg QID, but continued to have an elevated HR. He was not given a beta-blocker due to his concomitant asthma exacerbation ___ beta blockade. . # Pericarditis: After his admission, he had evidence on his ECG of pericarditis. Due to his recent STEMI it was thought to be secondary to inflammation, and unlikely to be a ___ syndrome given the timing of pericarditis ___. His INR was allowed to increase slowly due to concern about development of a pericardial effusion, but his ECHO did not show an effusion. . # DVT/PE: He has a known Factor V Leiden mutation (heterozygous) and he had a superficial femoral vein clot that was not completely occlusive. He had been treated for a DVT in the past, and therefore will require life long anti-coagulation. Due to his persistent sinus tachycardia both at the time of presentation, transfer to ___ and his hospital stay, it was presumed that he had a pulmonary embolus. He did not undergo a V/Q scan due to his history of asthma, and he did not undergo a CTA due to his ___. He was started on warfarin empirically for his apical hypokinesis, and his INR prior to discharge was 1.4. He was sent home with Lovenox. . # L sided Pleural Effusion/Retrocardiac opacity/PNA: After a discussion with radiology, and concomitant fever, he was diagnosed with HCAP and empirically started on Levaquin. He then spiked an additional fever, and was transitioned to Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin. He was then transitioned to oral antibiotics, and discharged home with oral cefpodoxime to complete an 8 day course. . # ___ on CKD: His creatinine was elevated at the OSH. He is listed as having known CKD. His creatine peaked at 1.8 and improved with mild IV hydration. The elevation in his creatinine was thought to be secondary to contrast nephropathy. Prior to discharge his was 1.4. . # Decreased TSH: Due to his persistent sinus tachycardia, his TSH was checked. He had a slightly abnormal TSH, and a T3 was normal and his T4 was only slightly above normal. . # Sinus Tachycardia: In the setting of his STEMI and recent DVT, his sinus tachycardia was multi-factorial. His sinus rate prior to decreased into the 90's while he was on diltiazem. . Chronic Issues: . # DM II (uncontrolled). He was diagnosed last year and started on oral medications, with a HgbA1C of 7.5. While he was admitted to the hospital he was kept on an ISS with lantus to help control his blood sugars. . # HTN: He presented with mild hypertension, that resolved. . # Dyslipidemia: His lipids were checked while he was hospitalized and his total cholesterol was 183 with an LDL of 101. He was started on high dose Atorvastatin 80 mg per-MI. .

Coronary catheterization demonstrated severe 3 vessel CAD with a 70-80% left main stenosis, an occluded RCA filled by collaterals distally, an 80% LAD in-stent stenosis, and a pair of 60% stenoses at the diagonal bifurcation and LCx. While indicated, CABG was felt to represent substantial risk with her multiple co-morbidities, and she and her family elected for left main stenting instead. She presents for pre-cath hydration in preparation for that procedure. . On arrival to the floor, her VS were T97.5 BP129/65 P64 RR20 Sat 93%/2L. She feels well. Since discharge she notes worsening functional tolerance, now taking longer to walk short distances, and noting aching leg pains and substernal chest pressure with exertion that relieves with rest. Also noting shortness of breath during those episodes, that reverses with rest. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> 1.

Probable intra-atrial conduction delay. Right bundle-branch block. Inferior and precordial lead ST-T wave changes are primary and non-specific but cannot exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of ___ no significant change. CXR ___: Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright position using AP frontal view and left lateral projection. Bilateral basal densities are indicative of pleural effusions concealing the diaphragmatic contours. The pleural effusion is more marked on the left side, also documented on the lateral view, extending into the posterior pleural sinuses. Heart size is difficult to assess conclusively, however, the significant upper zone redistribution pattern is indicative of at least some degree of left-sided CHF. Thoracic aorta is moderately widened and shows some calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch as illustrated on the lateral view. No apparent acute parenchymal infiltrates in the accessible pulmonary lung fields with the exception of a suspicious local infiltrate in the right mid lung field and the lung bases which are concealed by the pleural effusions. There exists no prior chest examination in our records available for comparison. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with left-sided CHF and bilateral pleural effusions. Suspicious local parenchymal infiltrate in mid lung field, but no other conclusive evidence for pulmonary processes. No pneumothorax in apical area. Follow up with short interval following CHF treatment is recommended. CXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left pleural effusion has mildly increased. The effusion on the right is distributed differently, but overall stable in extent. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and signs of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ___: 1. Coronary angiography revealed the following findings. The ___ revealed a known distal 70% stenosis. The LAD revealed a mid 80% in-stent restenosis (ISR) and a distal 50% stenosis. The LCx revealed ostial 30% and mid 60% stenoses. The RCA is 100% occluded and the distal vessel fills via left to right collaterals principally from the LCx. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 186 mmHg and a DBP of 71 mmHg. 3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD ISR with a Promus Rx 3.0x15 mm ___ with an NC 3.0 mm balloon. (see PTCA comments) 4. Successful PTCA/stenting of the distal LM with a Promus Rx 3.5x15 mm DES (distal tip in proximal LAD and proximal tip back to origin of LMCA). (see PTCA comments) 5. R and L arterial and venous sheaths sutured into position for removal post procedure FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Successful PTCA/stenting of an unprotected LMCA and LAD with DES with follow-up IVUS 2. Plan for R and L arterial and venous sheaths (with care not to compress the aorto-bifem grafts) when ACT appropriate 3. ASA indefinitely; plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily for at least 12 months and consider indefinite use; consider discontinuation of warfarin therapy 4. Plan for mucomyst and hydrate vigorously for prevention of contrast nephropathy. Although 85 cc of contrast used, patient has severe renal dysfunction at baseline and is at high risk for contrast nephropathy LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL U/S, REST ___: Doppler waveforms from the femoral to the dorsalis pedis artery are triphasic throughout. Ankle-brachial indices 0.85 on the right and 0.83 on the left. Pulse volume recordings show drop off at the calf level with further drop off distally. IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate bilateral popliteal/tibial artery occlusive disease. CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ___: 1. Limited coronary angiography revealed the following findings. The LMCA revealed a previously deployed stent in the LMCA extending into the LAD which remains widely patent. The LAD reveals widely patent stents in the proximal LAD, ostial 70% stenosis in DIAG1, 50% stenosis in distal LAD. The LCx reveals the ostium to be difficult to assess well angiographically because of the angle of take-off, but probable 50-60% stenosis, 60% stenosis in mid LCx at origin OM2. The RCA revealed a proximal 100% occlusion; distal vessel fills via well established collaterals from the left coronary, and principally from the LCx. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 192 mmHg and a DBP of 78 mmHg. 3. Negative pressure wire across ostium LCx, mid LCx, and DIAG1 showing that they are very unlikely to cause patient symptoms, so no intervention was performed. Even though collateral insufficiency to the RCA could be induced by less significant stenoses, ostial LCx stenosis is far more significant. Furthermore, treating mid LCx stenosis with a stent would likely compromise collateral flow to RCA from distal LCx which would be jailed and placed at significant jeopardy. 4. R ___ femoral artery sheath sutured into position for removal post procedure FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary anatomy unchanged from the end of procedure on ___ 2. Pressure wire studies across the ostium of LCx, mid LCx, and DIAG1 show that they are very unlikely to cause patient symptoms, so no interventions performed. Even though collateral insufficiency to the RCA could be induced by less significant stenoses, ostial LCx stenosis is far from significant. Furthermore, treating the mid LCx stenosis with a stent would likely compromise collateral flow to RCA from distal LCx which would be jailed and placed a significant jeopardy. 3. Mildly elevated LVEDP 4. Plan: medical therapy. If angina story convincing, most likely this is from collateral insufficiency. Will need to treat medically. Would also evaluate for non-cardiac etiology for chest pain. 5.

Your exertional symptoms are likely caused by your coronary disease, your COPD, and some fluid in your lungs from all the fluids ___ needed for these catheterizations. Your symptoms finally did improve enough to be discharged from the hospital. The following changes were made to your medications: 1. START AMLODIPINE 2.5mg twice a day 2. START XOPONEX inhaler, 2 puffs every ___ hours as needed for shortness of breath 3. CONTINUE PLAVIX 75mg daily for the next ___ months 4. DECREASE ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE to 120mg IN THE MORNING 5.

START PANTOPRAZOLE 20mg daily to control your reflux It is very important that ___ continue to take your clopidogrel every day to prevent your stents from clogging and causing a large heart attack. Also, please continue to take your aspirin every day. If ___ miss your dose for 48 hours or more, ___ will not be able to safely continue taking aspirin without undergoing desensitization again. Please continue your other previously prescribed medications It truly was a pleasure taking care of ___, Mrs. ___ ___ Instructions: ___","Mrs. ___ is an ___ with a history of severe CAD, COPD, CKD stage IV, HTN, HLD, PVD, who was re-admitted for a planned stenting of a severely diseased LMCA, but who experienced continued exertional chest pain and pressure following DES to LAD and LMCA, likely secondary to a combination of diffuse CAD, COPD, and pulmonary edema. ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: She has experienced persistent exertional angina over the past few weeks which has been functionally limiting. Severe left main coronary artery disease was discovered during her last hospitalization in ___ with a distal 70% stenosis. She underwent aspirin desensitization in the ICU during that admission and eventually declined CABG, so she returned for LMCA stenting. She presented early for pre-procedural hydration with NS, bicarbonate, and mucomyst given her severe chronic kidney disease (GFR 17). She underwent uncomplicated catheterization with DES placed to the LMCA and LAD. She continued to experience exertional chest pressure and shortness of breath after taking only a few steps. . She demonstrated transient anterolateral T wave inversions during these episodes, which quickly resolved with rest or nitrogylcerin SL. Of note, a 60% LCX lesion was noted on her previous cath, and the ostia was jailed by the new LAD stent. Due to suspicion that her LCx disease was driving these symptoms, she underwent repeat cath on ___, again with pre-procedural hydration protocol for renal protection. Pressure wire analysis failed to demonstrate significantly severe disease to merit intervention of the LCx lesion, which was not felt to be a likely culprit behind her chest symptoms. Furthermore, LCx stenting would likely jail and jeopardize collaterals to the RCA. Her medical regimen was expanded to include amplodipine 2.5mg BID for additional anti-anginal effect and her isosorbide was decreased to 120mg QD to allow an evening holiday with the hope of preventing tolerance. She continued aspirin, plavix x 12months, metoprolol, atorvastatin. 2. EXERTIONAL DYSPNEA/CHEST PRESSURE: She continued to note substernal chest pressure and dyspnea with minimal exertion following her first catheterization. As mentioned, repeat catheterization failed to demonstrate a probable epicardial source. Small vessel disease may be at fault, and her medical anti-anginal regimen was optimized as above. Her chest XR demonstrated pulmonary edema and effusion from preprocedural hydration. Her symptoms improved somewhat with diuresis, as well as sheduled albuterol nebs for suspected severe COPD. She received bronchodilators and occasional sublingual nitroglycerin prior to exertion with some improvement. While her functional tolerance did improve, she was discharged to acute rehab for more intensive physical therapy. She will most likely continue to experience chest pressure and dyspnea on mild exertion, which occurred frequently in house. These symptoms should preferentially be treated with rest, and use sublingual nitroglycerin if symptoms do not resolve after 5 minutes of rest. Would not recommend ED referral unless her symptoms are particularly severe or fail to respond to rest and nitroglycerin. 3. STAGE IV CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: She presented in stage IV renal disease with an estimated GFR of 17. She received saline, bicarbonaate, and mucomyst prior to catheterization. She developed acute on chronic kidney injury following her second catheterization, which was likely a combination of contrast nephropathy and pre-renal azotemia from lasix. Creatinine was stable at 2.8 at discharge. 4. COPD: She has moderate to severe COPD based on recent PFTs, currently controlled on tiotropium. She never tolerated advair or inhaled steroids due to hoarseness. She experienced some relief with scheduled albuterol nebs. She was discharged with levalbuterol inhaler to prevent some of the tachycardia associated with beta agonism due to her severe coronary disease. 5. EXERTIONAL LOWER EXTREMITY PAIN: She complains of bilateral posterior thigh pain with ambulation that radiates to the buttock. It improves with rest. Per her report, she had balloon angioplasty of bilateral lower extremity PVD at ___ in years past without stents. She underwent lower extremity arterial dopplers at rest, demonstrating only mild-to moderate occlusive disase with ABI of about 0.8 bilaterally. Her symptoms may therefore be related to general deconditioning, and she did note some improvement with physical therapy. 6. PREVIOUS PE: She had a suspected pulmonary embolus several years ago which was never fully established due to her refusal to undergo CTA. She had been on coumadin since that time, which was stopped prior to her catheterization. After discussion with her PCP, coumadin was not restarted. 7. ASPIRIN INDUCED BRONCHOSPASM: She was desensitized during her last hospitalization and continued daily full-dose aspirin without complication. 8. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Her lipid panel was checked during hospitalization with Cholesterol 142, ___ 114, HDL 44, and LDL 75. Atorvastatin 80mg daily was continued due to severe coronary disease. 9. HYPERTENSION: She continued metorpolol succinate, and amlodipine 2.5mg BID was added for anti-anginal effect. BP was well controlled. 10. ?HIT: She carries a likely diagnosis of HIT. Heparin products were avoided. 11. PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: She has a history pulmonary hypertension with peak TR velocity of 45-75 on ___ echo. Uncertain WHO classification given prior PE, COPD. 12.

LAD: The LAD tended to be selectively engaged with the JL4 and AL2 catheters with significant pressure dampening. Views with the AL2 in the LMCA showed a 40-50% near-ostial stenosis. There was a 50% stenosis in the proximal LAD prior to the first diagonal branch that appeared similar to the appearance in the prior angiogram from ___. The proximal LAD was calcified. D1 was of moderate caliber with a proximal 50% stenosis. A larger D2 had a moderate origin stenosis, a proximal 50% stenosis and diffuse plaquing throughout; its small medial pole had a significant origin stenosis (also seen on the prior angiogram). The major distal D3 ran parallel to the distal/apical LAD. The apical LAD either wrapped around the apex or supplied a modest caliber collateral to the LPDA. LCX: The LCX had a proximal 30% stenosis after a high modest OM1 followed by a large atrial branch. There was a large branching OM2 with mild plaquing throughout that arose from a 35% stenosis in the AV groove CX. The AV groove CX was severely narrowed just after OM2 and then totally occluded prior to the several stents seen in the mid-distal AV groove CX (without contrast filling). The atrial branch provided faint collaterals to the posterolateral wall. RCA: The RCA could not be engaged selectively with the JR4. Non-selective angiography confirmed the proximal tapering and proximal-mid vessel diffuse occlusion seen on the prior angiogram with delayed filling of a small caliber long RV branch. SVG-LPDA: The SVG proper was patent with minimal luminal irregularities. There was a 40% stenosis in the LPDA distal (antegrade) from the anastomosis. The LPDA gave off several laterally oriented sidebranches. There was retrograde perfusion of several LPL branches. There was also a tortuous apical collateral to the RV. Assessment & Recommendations 1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with moderate LAD stenoses unlikely to cause rest angina, but continued small vessel disease too small for PCI. 2. Patent SVG-LPDA with mild distal native disease. 3. Severe, poorly controlled systemic systolic arterial hypertension suggestive of malignant hypertension in the setting of acute NSTEMI. 4. No hemodynamic evidence of significant right subclavian artery in-stent restenosis. 5. No lesions conducive to PCI. 6. Suggest aggressive secondary preventative measures against CAD, hypertension, NSTEMI, and LV diastolic dysfunction, including continued clopidogrel for ___ year for post-MI secondary prevention, addition of amlodipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, maximal statin therapy, and referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Mr. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ ___.

You were admitted for a heart attack (non-ST elevation MI). We performed a procedure called cardiac catheterization, during which we found that you had blockage in the blood supply to your heart. Your blood pressure dropped slightly during the procedure, and you were transferred to our cardiac intesive care unit for further monitoring. During your second day in the CCU you developed a collection of blood in your abdomen and groin, and your blood pressure dropped. We placed a special line in your groin to give you medications, blood and fluids. Your blood pressure subsequently improved and you were ___ transferred to the general cardiology floor. You also developed an urinary tract infection during your hospital stay and were started on antibiotics, which you will need to continue taking twice a day for 6 more days (last date ___. We made the following changes to your medications: CHANGED: Aspirin from 81mg to 325mg daily STARTED: Atorvastatin once daily before bedtime Ciprofloxacin twice daily (continue until ___ Metoprolol once daily Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 1 tab if you have pain. You can take it up to 4 times a day Prasugrel once daily Pantoprazole once daily Please continue taking your other medications as usual. Please followup with your primary care practitioner and cardiologist, see below. ","___ year old female with a PMH notable for nonobstructive coronary artery disease, prior history of atrial fibrillation (not on coumadin), hyperlipidemia, and lupus who was transferred from ___ for catheterization following an NSTEMI. S/p DES to ___ and admitted to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring after an episode of hypotension in the cath lab requiring dopamine. . # Hypotension: Broad differential, but clinical presentation initially was most likely consistent with vagal episode. Patient found to have >1L CC of urine output once foley placed. Patient briefly required peripheral dopamine in cath lab in response to BP with systolics in the ___ but dopamine was quickly weaned without problems and pt was transported to CCU. At that time, TTE without evidence of tamponade, depressed LVEF, or perforation. REPEAT TTE ___ showed very mild focal left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Patient did not complain of abdominal or back pain following the procedure which argued against RP bleed. Pt did state she felt extremely thirsty and had not had anything to eat or drink since 9pm the evening prior. Her BPs responded to gentle hydration and remained stable in the ___ systolic overnight following the procedure. Home beta blocker was held. HCT remained relatively stable overnight so less concern for bleed, although on ___ AM pt was noted to have had a 3 point HCT drop from midnight labs, see abdominal wall hematoma below. In the setting of acute bleed BP dropped to as low as ___ systolic. Pt was started on dopamine and levophed and transfused with good effect on BP (up as high as 150s systolic) and quickly weaned from these medications. Patient is being discharged with stable blood pressure. #abdominal wall hematoma - the morning after admission it was noted that the pt had a HCT drop from 33.7 at midnight to 30.5. Pt had been on an integrillin drip since cardiac cath and intervention ___. Overnight pt had remained stable with BP in the low ___, received gentle hydration with IVF, and denied significant pain anywhere in the abdominal, back, or groin regions. pt had bilateral femoral catheterizations as she had become hypotensive following the initial catheterization and there was anticipation of possible need for intra-aortic balloon pump, although her pressures reponded quickly to dopamine and pump was never placed. The night following the procedure, frequent groin checks performed which showed present pulses, no hematoma, masses, evidence of bleeding, or audible bruits. Early morning after admission pt was noted to have some minor bleeding through the dressing of the left femoral catheter site but remained HDS and without complaints.

Mild mitral regurgitation STRESS ECHO ___ This ___ year old man with a history of asthma and s/p CABG ___ was referred to the lab for evaluation of shortness of breath. When the patient arrived to the lab he was actively wheazing. He was infused with 15 and 30 mcg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 6 minutes. The test was terminated due to exacerbation of his wheazing with obvious difficulties in his breathing. The patient reported through a ___ interpreter that he was having difficulty breathing. No other arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was noted by the patient throughout the study. The difficult breathing began at minute 5 of the infusion and resolved by minute 4 of recovery with 2 l/min of oxygen via nasal canula. The baseline inverted T waves in the inferolateral leads normalized with the infusion. The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. Increase in HR and BP on relative low dose infusion. Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 57 bpm and a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. At low dose dobutamine [15mcg/kg/min; heart rate 58 bpm, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg], there was mild augmentation of all left ventricular segments. At peak dobutamine stress [15 mcg/kg/min and 0 mg atropine; heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 180/80 mmHg), there was appropriate augmentation of systolic function of all segments with decrease in cavity size. Test was stopped prematurely due to patient coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. IMPRESSION: Study limited by exacerbation of asthma with no anginal type symptoms or significant ST segment changes. Nondiagnostic ECG changes with no 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to pharmacologic stress. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Aspirin 81 mg daily Lipitor 20 mg daily Metoprolol 50 mg bid Amlodipine 5 mg daily Tricor 48 mg daily Xopenex q6hrs prn <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

We performed an ECHO of your heart which showed normal heart function. A stress test did not show concerning changes but this study was limited by your asthma exacerbation. We made the following changes to your medications: 1. added prednisone for treatment of asthma to take over the next several days 2. added an inhaled steroid medication, fluticasone, to take daily. 3. you should continue to use xopenex intermittenly for asthma relief. 4. increased the dose of lipitor Please call your regular doctor or return to the ED if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, lightheadedness or any other symptoms. ","In brief, this is a ___ year old man with hypertension, dyslipidemia, ongoing cigarette use, CAD S/P CABG, and asthma presenting with chest pain and dyspnea. # CAD: Onset of pain at rest was concerning for UA. There was no ECG or biomarker evidence of myocardial infarction. Dobutamine echo (given his difficulty walking due to knee arthritis) was limited by asthma exacerbation, but his chest discomfort was not reproduced, and there was no objective evidence of ischemia. Initially, he was placed on Plavix, which was discontinued when stress test was negative for ischemia (arguing against an ischemic etiology of his chest pain). He remained chest pain free throughout this admission. Continued ASA, beta-blocker (as he had been on this prior to his respiratory deterioration) and statin. # SOB: Asthma exacerbation. Improved with steroids and nebulizers. Discharged on steroid ___ (q2 days) and inhalers (albuterol, fluticasone). # Hypertension: Remained controlled on amlodipine and beta-blocker. # Hyperlipidemia: This admission with HDL 37, LDL 96.

You had a stress test that was concerning for a clot in one of the arteries of your heart. You underwent cardiac catheterization which showed that you had a new clot in one of your arteries. A new stent was placed to open this area. It is very important to continue taking your medications regularly, especially Clopidogrel (Plavix), Aspirin, and Rosuvostatin (Crestor) in order to prevent your stents from closing and to protect your heart. We stopped one of your medications, Metoprolol, because we were concerned that it might make your heart rate too slow. Please follow up with you cardiologist to determine whether you should restart this at some point. Please avoid vigorous exercise for the next 7 days. After this time it is safe to engage in greater physical activity. It is also important to lead a healthy lifestyle and control your high blood pressure and Diabetes in order to prevent worsening heart disease. It is especially important to stop smoking. Cigarette smoking doubles your risk of coronary heart disease, and one year after you stop smoking the risk of dying from a heart attack decreases by about one-half! I have provided you with a prescription for nicotine patches if you would like to continue to use these once you leave the hospital. Please follow up with your primary care doctor for more help with quitting smoking. Medication changes STOP Metoprolol START Nicotine patch "," The patient is a ___ y/o female with history of CAD s/p DES to RCA ___, DM II, HTN, HCV, and neuropathy, who presents with several days of substernal chest pain and found to have a positive stress test. . # CORONARIES: Patient has a significant h/o CAD with inferior MI in the past and at the time of presentation was 6 months post DES to RCA for similar for angina. Following this procedure the patient's symptoms had completely resolved. However, one month prior to current presentation she had begun noticing exertional chest heaviness responsive to nitroglycerin, that acutely worsened within a few days of this hospitalization. In the ED EKG was notable only for slight bradycardia and non-specific ST/TW changes. Cardiac enzymes were negative and the patient underwent stress testing. This revealed reversible ischemic changes in the inferior and lateral leads in correlation with patient's symptoms. She underwent coronary angiography which revealed 70% ulcerated plaque in mid RCA, which was stented with a 2.75x15mm Promus ___ stent. The previous distal RCA stent was patent. The patient was continued on a cardioprotective medication regimen, including Plavix 75mg qd, aspirin 325mg qd and crestor 20mg daily. Her metoprolol was held due to sinus bradycardia. She remained hemodynamically stable and was chest pain free at the time of discharge. The importance of risk factor management including control of DM, HTN, HLP, and tobacco cessation was stressed prior to discharge. She will follow up with her cardiologist and PCP following discharge. . # RHYTHM: Patient was noted to be in sinus bradycardia on telemetry and EKGs with rate ranging from 34-56 with no associated symptoms. Given h/o inferior MI and disease of the RCA it is possible that she has suffered some ischemia to vessels of the conduction system. The patient does report h/o bradycardia to ___ noted in previous hospitalizations, and prior EKG in ___ also notes bradycardia, so that this could represent her baseline. Nonetheless it was felt safest to hold her metoprolol in this setting. . # Diabetes Mellitus II Poorly controlled with A1C 9.2 in ___. Maintained on home dose of 24U glargine QHS and humalog sliding scale started during her inpatient course.

You were admitted because you had a heart attack. Images of your heart (catheterization) showed that critical vessels that supply blood to your heart were blocked, and so 2 stents (drug-eluting) were placed in order to keep the blood vessels open. Echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of your heart) after the catheterization procedure showed impaired heart function. These findings predispose you to future heart problems, including fluid backup in your lower extremities and lungs. Please START taking the following medications in addition to your home medications: 1. Metoprolol - to lower your heart rate, control your blood pressure and help your heart pump better. 2. Atorvastatin - to lower your cholesterol and prevent future plaque build-up in your heart's arteries. 3. Plavix - to prevent re-occlusion of your stented arteries or blockage of the drug-eluting stent that was placed. 4. Aspirin - to prevent platelet blockage of the drug-eluting stent that was placed. 5. Lisinopril - to control your blood pressure and help your heart pump better. 6. Nitroglycerin - to alleviate heart-related chest pain. Please take this medication if you have chest pain at home that is similar to the chest pain that brought you to the hospital. Take one tablet, wait 5 minutes, then take another tablet. Please call ___ if you still have chest pain after 2 tablets, and please call Dr. ___ you use nitroglyerin at all. It is very important that you are compliant with these medications, especially Plavix (Clopidogrel) and Aspirin. Skipping or changing doses of these medications can result in life-threatening blockage of the arteries that were blocked during this heart attack. Do not stop unless your cardiologist, Dr. ___ you that it is ok. In addition, please: 1. Weigh yourself every morning, and call your primary care physician if your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs (total). 2. Continue the exercise plan that the physical therapist discussed with you during this admission. 3.

Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca. PTCA of vessel distal RCA and RPL branch followed by deployment of a 3.0 x 18 and a 3.0 x 8 mm Promus drug-eluting stents, reducing a 99% stenosis to 0% residual stenosis. 3. Patient will remain on aspirin indefinitely and prasugrel for one year. TTE ___: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction. Pulmonary artery hypertension. CXR PA and Lateral ___: FINDINGS: No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No definite focal pneumonia. On the lateral view, there is suggestion of some increased opacification at the base in the retrocardiac region. This may well represent only crowding of vessels and mild atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.

You were transferred to ___ from ___ for a cardiac catheterization which showed a clot and blockage in one of your heart arteries on the right side. You received two drug eluting stents to keep the artery open and you will need to take aspirin and prasugrel every day for at least one year and possibly longer. Do not stop taking these medicines or miss any doses unless Dr. ___ you it is OK. This is extremely important to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack. You will have some nitroglycerin to use at home if you have any further chest pain at home. You can take one tablet under your tongue, wait 5 minutes and take one more tablet. If you still have chest pain after 2 tablets, call ___. Please let Dr. ___ if you take ANY nitroglycerin. You had some fevers that we think may be due to a pneumonia and you will be on antibiotics for one week to treat this. Please call Dr. ___ you develop fevers again and take tylenol for any fever or achiness at home. . We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. START taking levofloxacin to treat what might be a pneumonia for 7 days. 2. START taking Prasugrel 10 mg and Aspirin 325 mg daily to prevent the stents from clotting off. 3. START taking metoprolol to slow your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack. 4. START taking Atorvastatin to lower your cholesterol 5. START taking nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain. Please call Dr. ___ the ___ if you have any chest pain at all. ","Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a PMH significant for unilateral kidney, ADHD, and hyperlipidemia who presents with chest pain and concern for NSTEMI who converted to STEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization with 2DES to RPL. Active Diagnoses: # STEMI: Patient is obese, has hyperlipidemia, and had some classic signs of MI on presentation (chest pain at rest, diaphoresis) with continued rise in troponins. Pt was started on a heparin drip. He was also placed on a nitro drip for pain control. He was taken urgently to cath ___ ___levations in inferior leads. Has found to have tight stenosis in RPL, CTO of the RPDA. 2 drug eluting stents were placed in the RPL. Post-procedure, patient had no further CP. He was started on Toprol XL 50mg daily, ASA 325, atorvastatin 80mg daily and prasugrel. Peak CK's 815 with trop 2.45. A1C nl and lipid panel with LDL at 127, <70 is goal. Mr. ___ did not have recurrence of chest pain after the procedure. # Fever: Two days prior to discharge, patient spiked fever, as high as 102.4F. He felt myalgias, but denied headache, dyspnea, cough, sputum production, dysuria. Fever responded to tylenol, but patient continued to spike over next day. Developed some diarrhea, but was C. diff negative. Rapid flu was negative at time of discharge. He was started on levofloxacin and will continue on discharge for 1 week course given questionable infiltrate on CXR which is concerning for pneumonia. He was afebrile at the time of discharge. # Mild tranaminitis: No abdominal pain to suggest acute etiology, has had elevated ALT in past but not elevated AST, most recently checked ___. RUQ ultrasound showed fatty infiltration, no acute changes, possible cyst vs granuloma, suggest repeat in 3 months. Hep serologies negative for acute infection. Patient will follow-up ultrasound with PCP. # ADD/Depression: He was continued on Wellbutrin and Prozac per home regimen. Ritalin was held in the setting of ACS. TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: -Repeat US will be required in 3 months (or MRI immediately) to evaluate 2.1 hypoecoic liver mass. RUQ U/S findings IMPRESSION: 1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other forms of liver disease, including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. 2. 2.1-cm hypoechoic region in left lobe of liver is favored to represent focal fatty sparing, although a solid liver nodule cannot be excluded. This could be further evaluated with MRI. If MRI is not performed, then short interval followup with repeat ultrasound in three months is recommended. 3. Simple cyst in right hepatic lobe and probable granuloma in left lateral segment (versus biliary hamartoma). 4. Absent right kidney. Parapelvic cyst in upper pole of left kidney. 5. Fundal adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder without evidence of gallstones. ",3394,711,13

","In summary, the patient is a ___ male with PMH significant for HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD, s/p MI x 4 ( CABG x 4 in ___, s/p SVG-OM2 stenting in ___ and re-stenting in ___ (DES), & known occluded SVG-RCA, severe PVD with multiple stents, and s/p renal artery and carotid artery stenting who presents now with history consistent with stable angina. . #. Unstable Angina /Coronary Artery Disease: Mr. ___ has multiple risk factors including multiple prior MIs, hyperlipidemia, extensive CAD, widespread peripheral vascular disease and current tobacco abuse. Per history, he claimed he had not had active anginal symptoms in ~ ___ years. However, his family and spouse claimed he had more frequent episodes that occured so this timeline was questioned and his presentation was more fitting for stable angina vs. unstable angina. Given his complex cardiac anatomy with multiple stents and grafts, a new blockage in a coronary graft or a stent re-occlusion was initially questioned. Fortunately, his EKG showed no ST-elevations or ST-depressions and overall, his EKG was largely unchanged when compared to prior EKG from ___. His CAD history is notable for four prior myocardial infarctions, and a quadruple CABG in ___. He is also status-post SVG-OM2 graft stenting in ___ and again in ___. He has a known occluded SVG-RCA. Mr. ___ cardiac enzymes were trended and were all negative for an acute event. Telemetry showed no new concerning ectopy. He was continued on medical management with daily 325mg aspirin, Plavix, statin therapy with lipitor, and Toprol XL. Repeat lipid profile showed good control with LDL 51, total cholesterol 119, and HDLs also 51. He was also ordered for additional PRN SL NTG but he had no significant repeat chest pains after transfer to ___. Because his pain subsided, no IV anticoagulation was started overnight. He was set up for a stress MIBI in the morning to assess perfusion defects/ischemia. Stress ECHO showed no significant ECG changes during dobutamine infusion. 2D echocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction was present without any new inducible ischemia. He had a normal hemodynamic response to dobutamine infusion. Thus, he was not felt to have any new occlusions and no additional interventions were planned. Instead his medical management was adjusted for better symptomatic relief of his stable angina, and at time of discharge his Isosorbide Dinitrate was uptitrated to 40mg PO TID. He was also transfused with one unit of blood for his underlying anemia (Hct 26) which was also likely contributing to his frequent angina. . #. Grade I/II Systolic and Grade I Diastolic Heart Failure: Last ECHO ___ showed some mild diastolic dysfunction and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of basal to mid-inferolateral wall and some hypokinesis of the mid-to- distal septum. The remaining segments contracted normally and his LVEF was 45-50 %. Clinically, the patient seemed euvolemic on this admission with no signs of acute decompensation. He had a normal range JVP, and no crackles on lung exam. No pedal edema and no prominent dyspnea complaints at rest. Repeat ECHO on this admission showed similar results to prior ECHO with no new regional wall motion abnormalities and no new significant valve disease. LVEF was also about the same at 45-50%. Mr. ___ was continued on his ACE-inhibitor/lisinopril and Toprol XL therapy. He was also reminded to limit his daily sodium intake and to weigh himself daily and notify his doctor if he gained more than 3 lbs. . #. Rhythm: The patient has a known history of first degree A-V delay and bradycardia in the aftermath of his prior inferior MI. On this admission his heart rate was mostly in the 6Os, NSR, ___ degree AV prolongation remained. Continuous telemetry monitoring picked up only rare PVCs, and repeat EKGs did not reveal any new concerning arrhythmias. . #Hypertension: On arrival to the cardiology floor his blood pressures were in the 130s/60s range but he had missed some of his usual home medications per family. Later, repeat measures showed lower normotensive ranges. Thus, he was continued on the same daily regimen of his usual Norvasc, Lisinopril, and Toprol XL. . # Smoking: Smoking cessation counseling was re-emphasized on admission and throughout his hospital course. . #Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Unclear etiology, likely related to his long-term hypertension. Baseline creatinine ___ range per OSH records. On transfer creatinine was 2.29 and it improved to 2.0 at time of discharge. Team monitored daily BUN/Cr trend closely. . #Hyperkalemia: Just prior to transfer his potassium was elevated to 5.4 at outside hospital. He was given some kayexalate and repeat potassium levels after arrival to ___ were improved to 4.7 and 4.6. This rise was likely due to his constipation which had been worsened by recent high dose iron infusions. He was placed on a bowel regimen as outlined below. Otherwise, he is on an ACE-I and he has some underlying chronic renal insufficiency at baseline which both predispose him to some high-normal range potassium levels. . #. Peripheral Vascular Disease: He has a history of severe PVD with multiple stents in place. He is status-post left iliac stenting, which was then re-stented for restenosis. He also had a prior fem-fem bypass for right iliac occlusion. He has been followed closely by Dr. ___ for ___ years. He continues to have mild to moderate claudication symptoms at baseline. He was continued on his usual daily 325mg aspirin and Plavix. . # Anemia: Per patient's daughter his last colonoscopy was a little over year ago and he is due for a repeat colonoscopy later this month which will be set-up over this next week per family. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in ___ and he is status-post colectomy, also done in ___. Currently, he denies bloody stool on history. Last Hematocrit in OMR was in ___ and was in the ___ range. Now he presents with a Hct in the 26 range. MCV of 73 is consistent with microcytic anemia which was recently diagnosed according to the patient's family. He was given IV iron infusions 2 days prior to this admission in light of this new diagnosis. This explains his current iron level of 582. Otherwise, his B12 and folate levels were in normal ranges and his TIBC, ferritin, and transferrin were all normal as well. Patient was asked to follow-up with his primary care M.D. within 2 weeks of discharge for ongoing evaluation of his anemia, particularly with his colon cancer history. CEA was checked and was WNL and LFTs all WNL as well. Mr. ___ anemia was likely contributing to some of his more frequent anemia as well. Thus, he was consented and transfused with 1 unit of blood prior to his discharge. He was also asked to continue oral iron tablets with additional Colace for constipation prevention. . #. Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Mr. ___ was continued on a cardiac healthy diet and was briefly kept NPO for stress testing. Team monitored electrolytes and he was repleted daily as needed. . #. Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on SCDs/pneumoboots for DVT prevention, and Colace/Senna were given for bowel regimen in setting of recent iron infusion and constipation. . #.Code Status: The patient was maintained as a full code status for the entirety of his hospital stay, this was confirmed with the patient. . .

You were transferred from ___ with concerns for unstable angina and heart issues. You were medically optimized with Aspirin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and heparin before proceeding to the cardiac catheterization lab. Your cardiac catheterization showed evidence of an occluded branch off of the left anterior descending artery which was not intervened upon; it also showed stenosis of a the right coronary artery which was stented with a single drug-eluting stent. You also had an exercise stress test prior to discharge which showed no EKG changes of concern and you had no pain symptoms. You were discharged in stable condition. . Please call your doctor or go to the emergency department if: * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness. * Worsening swelling in your legs or a weight gain of 3 lbs or more, fatigue or excessive weakness. * You develop new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. * You are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids, or your medications. * If you are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include: dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing. * You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit, or have a bowel movement. * You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your urine, or experience an unusual discharge. * Your pain is not improving within 12 hours or is not under control within 24 hours. * Your pain worsens or changes location. * You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius. * You develop any other concerning symptoms. . CHANGES IN YOUR MEDICATION RECONCILIATION: * Upon admission, we ADDED the following medications: You should START: Aspirin 325 mg PO daily You should START: Metoprolol 50 mg XL PO once daily You should START: Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily You should START: Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily You should CHANGE: increase your Lisinopril from 20 mg to 40 mg PO daily You should START: Nicotine 14 mg TD patch daily You should START: Imdur 30 mg PO daily You should START: Colace and Senna for a bowel regimen . * The following medications were DISCONTINUED on admission and you should NOT resume: DISCONTINUE: Atenolol .

","IMPRESSION: ___ with a PMH significant for CAD (s/p MI ___ without intervention), CVA/stroke (___), L carotid stenosis, recurrent DVT (on Coumadin, INR 1.6 on admission), who presented to ___ with unstable angina, who was medically optimized and transferred to ___ for further management . PLAN: # CORONARIES - The patinet has no history of cardiac catheterization procedures, but pharmacologic-stress with perfusion at the outside hospital (___) showed anterior and anteroapical ischemia with no fixed deficits. The EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia at 49, NA, TWI lead aVL, with no acute ST-changes. The patient's troponins were negative times three-sets at the outside hospital. The patient was started on Aspirin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and heparin gtt as the outside hospital before transfer. The patient went for cardiac catheterization on ___ which showed evidence of right-sided coronary artery stenosis and a single drug-eluting stent was placed in this area; there was also an occluded diagonal branch off the LAD which was not intervened upon. Following her cardiac cath, the patient developed an episode of substernal chest pain and jaw pain with associated hypertensive urgency requiring a Nitroglycerin gtt for control of her systolic blood pressure. Serial EKGs were concerning for areas of ST-elevation in leads II, III and ST changes in leads V1-3. She was re-loaded with Plavix 300 mg PO, received an Aspirin 325 mg PO and was restarted on a heparin gtt, all on the evening of ___ (into the early morning hours of ___ following her cardiac cath procedure. Her CK-MBs were trended and were normal and reassuring. With the above medical optimization, her chest and jaw pain subsided without further issue. There was concern that the RCA stent was not treating her symptoms and that the occluded diagonal lesion may be the culprit. On ___, a low intensity exercise stress test was performed to assess for residual pain and showed a hypertensive response to exercise with no anginal type symptoms or ST-changes at a high cardiac demand and a poor functional capacity. We added Imdur 30 mg PO daily for better BP control and to improve her anginal symptoms. The patient had no further issues with chest pain and serial EKGs were reassuring. She was discharged in stable condition. . # PUMP - The patient had a 2D-Echo in ___ showing that ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function were normal (LVEF >55%) and on recent perfusion study her LVEF was 55%. There is no evidence of CHF, as she has no volume overload (stable left leg swelling, no crackles or elevated JVD). She was continued on her home dose of Lisinopril, was started on Metoprolol and her daily weights were monitored, her I/Os were monitored and she was assessed daily for volume overload. . # RHYTHM - The patient was noted to be in sinus bradycardia on admission with some ___ second pauses on telemetry. She was asymptomatic (no syncope, lightheadedness or dizziness). We continued to monitor her and performed electrolyte optimization with continuous telemetry monitoring. . # DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2 - The patient has a known history of NIDDM, has been on Levemir in the past, but has discontinued Insulin in the last 6-months. She is currently on Metformin at home and has been on Actos previously. Her HbA1c is unknown and was noted to be 10.7% this admission. She has no evidence of retinopathy or nephropathy; but she does have evidence of left leg neuropathy (has been on Tramadol PRN). We discussed that she should consider starting Gabapentin or another neuropathic pain medication for LLE neuropathy as an outpatient. We monitored her blood glucose Q6 hours and continued her on an insulin sliding scale. Her oral hypoglycemics were held until she resumed diet and following her cardiac catheterization procedure. . # HYPERTENSION - The patient has a history of hypertension controlled with ACEI, beta-blocker (Atenolol on admission) with Imdur, and we continued her on the above regimen, with the addition of Amlodipine for further control; her goal SBP was < 130/80. She was weaned from the Nitroglycerin infusion as noted above with transition to an oral anti-hypertensive regmien, without issues. . # HISTORY OF DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS - The patient has a history of recurrent DVTs of the LLE, but without pulmonary embolus history. The patient has been on Coumadin with regular INR checks and her three DVT events were when she was not anticoagulated. She arrived heparinized given the concern for ACS. Once heparin was discontinued on ___, her Coumadin dose of 5 mg PO daily was re-initiated with good effect. . # TOBACCO USE - The patient is a current 1-PPD smoker with over 30 pack-year; patient has a desire to quit and realizes the implications of continued smoking on her heart disease. She was prescribed a Nicotine patch 14 mg TD daily patch this admission, and we provided smoking cessation counseling provided. . TRANISTION OF CARE ISSUES: 1. Please follow-up with your primary care physician as an outpatient. 2. You should continue regular follow-up with Cardiology. 3. There were no pending laboratory studies, radiology reports or microbiology studies at the time of discharge. 4. The patient was discharged on Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily and prior authorization forms were completed and faxed to Mass Health before her discharge. ",3920,1259,13

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to ___ for a chest pain that is unlike your usual anginal symptom. The CT scan of your chest showed no lung clots or aortic aneurysm but it did show stable small lung nodules compared to the past. The EKG for your heart did not show concerning changes compared to the past, and the lab studies did not signs of injury in your heart. The chest pain you are experiencing is less likely from the heart. However, you have had recent events when you passed out. It is less likely that this is from low blood pressure with positional changes. Your blood pressure and heart rate actually remained stable with positional changes. It is possible that the fainting is due to arrythmia in your heart. You were offered to have ___ of Heart to monitor the rhythm of your heart to look for causes of these fainting spells. However, you decided not to wear it because you don't have a land line to call in if you were to be informed of arrhythmias. Please note that there is NO change in your medication list. You should continue to take your current medications as prescribed by your health care providers. Please follow up with your primary care physician and your cardiologist as scheduled. - Your primary care provider ___ need to help you to monitor the small stable lung nodules found on the CT scan of your chest as well manage your coronary artery disease and other chronic illness. - You can discuss with your cardiologist about the potential of using ___ of Heart during your appointment with him. Even though you have not had a acute episode of heart failure, you should weight yourself regularly to know what your normal weight is. Signs of heart failure include fatigue, worsening shortness of breath, swelling in your lower extremities and/or belly, and discomfort in your chest. You should let your doctor know if your weight increased more than 3 lbs and with the above mentioned symptoms. ","This is a ___ yo M with history of MI s/p CABG and stent admitted for chest pain on ___ and discharged on ___. 1. Chest pain, likely musculoskeletal. Patient reported this chest pain felt different than the one that brought him into the hospital last month, as this one is more throbbing in nature after changing a tire. Given his significant cardiac history, he was evaluated for ACS. His cardiac biomarkers remained negative 3x and EKG without much change during hospital stay despite the fact that the chest pain started the day PTA. Of note, d-dimer was elevated. A CTA was done to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism or aortic aneurysm/dissection; however, no pulmonary embolism or aortic aneurysm/dissection was found. Last hospital course was reviewed along with the previous cardiac catheterization report and stress test, it is thought that he most likely have small vessel CAD that cannot be intervened by cardiac catheterization. His chest pain was also atypical for ACS with relief mostly from percocet and morphine. Patient refused to use nitroglycerin for chest pain during the hospital course as it causes him headache. No new antianginal medication was started at this time. His medications were unchanged during this hospital course. This should be followed up closely with his primary care physician as well as his cardiologist. Additional antianginal medication, such as ranolazine, could be considered for the future. 2. Syncope. It was noted that patient had history of seizure and has been off of Dilantin for some time. He experienced 1x syncope after the nuclear stress test during his last hospital stay. At that time, it was thought this could be due to orthostatic hypotension. He had another episode on the day of admission. Patient was unable to elaborate much about the event as he did not remember, but he did not recall feeling warm or nauseous prior to passing out. Orthostatic blood pressure was obtained during this hospital course, and it was found to be BP 102/44 and HR 44 (lying), 100/40 and HR 52 (sitting), 96/50 and 48 (standing). He was asymptomatic throughout the process. When he was walking in the hall way, no concerning abnormal rhythm was observed on telemetry. Patient was initially open to wearing ___ of Heart monitor to monitor for concerning arrhythmia that could be potentially the cause of his syncope, but he later declined because he does not have a land line phone for communication. This should be followed up by his primary care physician and cardiologist. If cardiac causes can be ruled out in the outpatient setting, may need to consider a neurological cause for these syncopes. 3. Small vessel CAD. He continued on home rosuvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, ASA 325 mg, and metoprolol XL 200 mg upon discharge to home. This should be followed up again by his primary care physician and cardiologist. See #1 for details. 4. COPD, chronic. Patient was in no acute respiratory distress during the hospital course. Per patient, he has been cutting down on the amount of tobacco smoking. Albuterol was initially held during the work up for ACS. However, as he ruled out for an ACS, he was restarted on albuterol. He refused his other COPD medications, such as Advair. Patient was discharged on home medications. This can be followed up again by his primary care physician. 5. Hypertension. BP remained within acceptable range while in house. Patient was continued and discharged on home medication. This can be followed up again by his primary care physician. 6. Hyperlipidemia. Lipid profile with elevated LDL. No change was made. He was discharged on home Crestor. This should be followed up by his primary care physician. ",3601,812,13

You were admitted because of chest pain and shortness of breath. You were found to have a pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. You were treated with antibiotics and breathing treatments. Cardiac enzymes and ekgs showed that you were not having a heart attack. It is very important that you quit smoking tobacco. This pneumonia likely occurred because your smoking made it difficult for your lungs to clear an infection. Continuing smoking will worsen your respiratory status as well as your heart. You should also take all the medications prescribed to you. This includes tiotropium inhaler and advair inhaler as well as albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath and wheezing. These are important for improving your breathing. If you do not take these medications you will be at increased risk for COPD exacerbations. Please call if you develop increasing shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, worsening chest pain not resolved with pain medication, or any other symptoms that concern you. *************** Please START the following medications: -Cefpodoxime 200mg to be taken every 12h x2 days Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. ","Mr ___ is a ___ with hx CAD s/p cabg, s/p c. cath x8 and pci x3, with poorly managed copd, persistent tobacco abuse and recent hospitalization for spinal fusion surgery who presents with sob and cp x6 days. Given the patient's symptoms, his fever, presence of infiltrate in RML and flat cardiac enzymes, it appears that he is most likely suffering from pna with component of copd exacerbation. He was ruled out for ACS. . # PNA: started on ceftriaxone/azithro in the ED for RML infiltrate. Given recent hospitalization, could be concerned for HAP however remained afebrile on CAP regimen. Also on previous admission there was concern for aspiration. Patient remained afebrile throughout admission. He completed a 5 day course of azithromycin and was discharged with cefpodoxime to complete a 7day course. # COPD: The patient presented with increased O2 requirement, increased sputum production, and wheezes/poor air movement on exam. It was felt that a component of his sob/cp was ___ COPD. He received prednisone 60mg x3 days, ipratroprium nebs q6h, albuterol q2h prn wheezing/sob. His sats and O2 requirement improved to home levels, room air during the day with 2L at night while sleeping. Of note the patient was refusing advair during admission, stating, ""I only use the marroon one at home"", it was thought he was referring to an albuterol inhaler. He was counseled that it is important to utilize all of his copd medications and discharged with prescriptions in case he does not have them at home. He was also counseled regarding smoking cessation and explained the role smoking can play in decreasing respiratory status and cardiac disease. However, he expressed no interest in stopping, stating that he had stopped smoking and drinking once and attributed it to causing his heart attack. He has recently increased tobacco use from ___ to 1ppd. . # CORONARIES: hx of CAD s/p cabg ___ ago (unclear why had MI at such a young age, denies cocaine) and multiple caths and pcis since. ___ stress shows small area of reversibility in the distal anterior wall adjacent to his infarct and angiogram/cardiac catheterization from ___ has been reviewed by our interventional cardiologists multiple times and it has been determined that there are no revascularizable vessels.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to ___ because you had a heart attack. Because of this, you had a cardiac catheterization in which a drug coated stent was placed to open a blockage in your left anterior descending coronary artery. You have some residual blockages that were not intervened upon. You were started on medications to prevent them from progressing and will need a stress test in the near future to determine if they need to be treated with a stent at that time. This should be coordinated at your follow-up appointment with your cardiologist at ___ and ___. If at any point between now and your appointment you develop chest pain, please go to hospital for urgent medical evaluation. Instructions regarding care of the right radial/wrist access site and right femoral/groin access site have been included with your discharge information. Please continue your current medications with the following changes: - Start Aspirin 81mg daily, lifelong. - Start Ticagrelor 90mg twice a day, you should take this for a minimum of one year and ONLY stop when told by a cardiologist specifically. - Start Metoprolol XL 50mg daily, which helps relax your heart and lowers your blood pressure. - Start Lisinopril 5mg daily, which lowers your blood pressure and improves survival after a heart attack. - Start Atorvastatin 80mg daily, which lowers cholesterol and inflammation in your arteries. - A nitroglycerin prescription has been provided to take as needed for chest pain. Place one under your tongue at onset of chest pain. This can be repeated every five minutes times three doses. If you continue to have chest pain after three doses, call ___ for urgent medical evaluation. It is very important to take all of your heart healthy medications. In particular, aspirin and ticagrelor keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot forming in your heart stents, and you may die from a massive heart attack. Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications. It is recommended that you attend a cardiac rehab program in the near future. A referral form was provided to you that lists the locations of these programs. Please bring this with you to your follow up visit with your cardiologist, and they will inform you when it is safe to begin a program. If you have any urgent questions that are related to your recovery from your hospitalization or are experiencing any symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine ___ at ___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse practitioner.

Please see appointment details below. ","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ year old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and peripheral neuropathy, who presents with increasing diarrhea. Became tachycardic and hypotensive in the emergency department. She was found to have ST depressions in the precordial leads on EKG. . # CORONARIES: Ms. ___ had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath during her hostpialization. Her initial EKG demonstrated diffuse T-wave inversions and mild ST depression (~ 0.___epression in the precordial leads). Although her initial troponins in the ED were < .01, her EKG changes were concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. Because of her strong risk factors (smoking history, hypertension) for ACS, she was started on a baby aspirin. She was admitted overnight to r/o MI. On hospital day 2, her serial troponins remained negative. Her lipid panel and HgbA1c were as follows: Chol 157 ___ 75 HDL 85 LDL 57. She was not started on a statin during her hospitalization. Because the patient had consumed caffeine on the morning of discharged, we decided to complete a pharmacologic stress test as an outpatient. We recommended follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient, if her stress test returned back positive. . # Tacyhcardia: In the ED, she had several episodes of SVT and had a short run of V Tach. She received 2 L of normal saline in the ED. She converted spontaneously into normal sinus rhythm. She had one episode of atrial tachycardia on the inpatient floor. Her tachycardia was mostly likely related to volume depletion after weeks of diarrhea. During her hospitalization, we held her dose of lasix and recommend . # Diarrhea: H/x of lymphocytic colitis. Stools were nonbloody. She had no fevers or leukocytosis since admission. Lactate was 1.6. her diarrhea resolved overnight. She had been started on entacort 3mg tid. C. diff and stool studies were unable to be completed since the patient's diarrhea resolved overnight. . # Urinary Tract infection: U/A in the ED revealed 13 WBCs, mod leukocytes, and many bacteria. She received 1 dose of ciprofloxacin 400mg IV in the ED. She was continued on ciprofloxacin 400mg PO bid. The patient did not complain of dysuria on admission, but the plan was to treat with a three day course of antibiotics. . # Hypertension: SBP were in ___ in the ED. Received 2L of NS. Her SBP remained in the low 100s. She did receive a dose of metoprolol on the day of admission. We restarted her lisinopril 20mg in the morning and we continued to hold her dose of lasix. We recommended holding the lasix until her follow-up appointment with Dr. ___. . # Peripheral neuropathy: Has a history of bilateral leg numbness and paresthesias from the feet to the knees. She was continued on her home dose of cymbalta. . # Tobacco use: Received a nicotine patch while she was an inpatient. . # Anemia: Hct 34.0 in ED. Baseline Hct ___. MCV is 102. ? whether anemia is related to vitamin deficiency (folate or B12) or alcohol use or chronic blood loss. We checked B12 and folate levels, but these lab values were pending on the day of discharge. These studies should be followed up by her primary care physician. . # Depression: stable. She was continued on cymbalta. . FEN: regular diet, replete lytes prn . ACCESS: PIV's . PROPHYLAXIS: -DVT ppx with SQ heparin -Hold bowel regimen in the setting of recent diarrhea. .

","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG x2, hypertension, type II diabetes and hyperlipidemia who presented to ___ with unresponsiveness at home found to have acute pulmonary edema and elevated cardiac enzymes. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient is s/p CABG in ___ and redo in ___. His most recent catheterization in ___ revealed an occluded LMCA, patent LIMA to LAD, occluded LCx filled by collaterals, occluded RCA with PDA filled by patent SVG, PL filled by collaterals from PDA. He is now s/p NSTEMI which likely occurred between ___ to ___ associated with acute pulmonary edema. On admission to ___ there was concern that he had LBBB on EKG but he has had rate dependent LBBB with stress testing here in the past. On arrival to this hospital he was chest pain free and reported feeling well. Given his previous cateterizations which revealed diffuse disease it was felt that there was no indication for repeat evaluation. He was continued on aspirin, plavix, ranolazine and imdur. His atenolol was changed to metoprolol and titrated up as tolerated. He recently was noted to have myalgias and elevated CKs and his statin was subsequently held. He was monitored on telemetry during this admission and found to be in atrial tachycardia with rates in the ___ but without further arrhythmias. He will follow up with his primary cardiologist Dr. ___. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient presented to ___ with acute pulmonary edema and subsequently had an elevation of his cardiac enzymes. Echocardiogram at ___ ___ estimated his ejection fraction at 30%. On presentation to this hospital he had mild lower extremity edema and trace crackles in his lungs. He was treated with IV lasix with good effect. As above his atenolol was switched to metoprolol and titrated up as tolerated. During this admission he was noted to be in atrial tachycardia with rates in the ___. There was concern that given his extremely poor systolic function he was not tolerating this faster rhythm well. He underwent transesophageal echocardiogram with subsequent EP ablation of his atrial tachycardia with subsequent maintanance of sinus rhythm. He tolerated this well. He was felt to be euvolemic at the time of discharge. Atrial Tachycardia: As above, the patient was noted to be in atrial tachycardia with rates in the ___ on telemetry. He underwent transesophageal echocardiogram with subsequent EP ablation of atrial tachycardia with resulting sinus rhythm. He was anticoagulated with heparin ___ and subsequently transitioned to coumadin which he will take for one month for stroke prevention. On discharge he was placed on lovenox which he will take until his INR his therapeutic. Hypertension: His blood pressures were well controlled on this admission. He was continued on Imdur and Nifedipine. His atenolol was transitioned to metoprolol which he tolerated well. Familial hypercholesterolemia: His last lipid panel ___ showed Chol 195, ___ 186, HDL 26, LDL 132. In ___ he presented to his primary care physician with myalgias and weakness. He was found to have elevated CKs as well as liver function tests. His atorvastatin and zetia were subsequently discontinued with improvement in his CKs. His liver function tests remained elevated which is likely secondary to hepatic venous congestion from right sided heart failure. He underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound during this admission which showed a normal liver contour but confirmed hepatic venous congestion. He will follow up with his cardiologist for consideration of rechallenge with lipid agents. Diabetes mellitus Type 2: His Last HgA1c 5.9% in ___. He has recently had episodes of hypoglycemia on his 70/30 regimen in the setting of poor PO intake. His 70/30 was decreased with good effect. Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's baseline creatinine ranges from 1.9-2.5. His creatinine was at baseline during this admission. His medications were renally dosed. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient is s/p aortobifemoral bypass. He had evidence of good distal perfusion on exam. He was continued on aspirin and plavix. Depression/Anxiety: No active inpatient issues. He was continued on celexa. Tobacco Use: Counselled regarding the importance of smoking cessation. He was given a prescription for a nicotine patch.

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: - high blood pressure - high cholesterol We are changing your medications as follows: - starting aspirin 81 mg - starting atorvastatin 80 mg - starting metoprolol - starting lisinopril Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team ","___ year old woman with a history of MI s/p CABG x 4 in ___, who presented with acute onset of aphasia and R sided weaknesss as well as STEMI, s/p TPA at an OSH for acute stroke, who was transferred to ___ for post TPA management. # Left MCA Ischemic Strokes (parietal and frontal): MRI confirms left MCA stroke of the inferior division as well as distal superior division branch. Her course has been complicated by worsening of right sided weakness after presentation as well as a small left medial temporal lobe hemorrhage which is likely from the tPA. On exam she has profound aphasia and right sided weakness. Stroke workup revealed HBA1c 6, LDL 220. She was started on ASA 81mg and atorvastatin 80mg daily. SBP was maintained under 160 given the hemorrhage. She was monitored on tele for afib as a cardioembolic source is the most likely etiology of her stroke. There were frequent PVCs but no atrial fibrillation on her telemetry. She was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor for 30 days monitoring. # ST Elevation Myocardia Infarction and acute systolic heart failure: Upon arrival to the ___ ED after receiving tPA at ___ ___, the patient developed ST elevations in her inferior and septal leads. She was seen by cardiology and was not taken to the cath lab since the recent tPA bolus would make this procedure too high risk. The tPA given for stroke likely helped treat her STEMI as well. Given the concurrent STEMI with stroke, she may have a cardioembolic source for both (with the most likely etiology being afib, although this has not been caputured). Alternatively, her STEMI may be neurogenic, particularly as she infarcted her insula. She developed hypoxia from pulmonary edema ___ requiring IV lasix. Echo revealed an EF of 38%, worsened from recent echo ___ with EF 50-55%. She was unable to be anticoagulated acutely after the STEMI given her IPH. Cardiology was consulted. She was started on lisinopril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol. Her blood pressure has been elevated and so her lisinopril has been increased to 20 mg daily and her metoprolol has been advanced to goal metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily. # Leukocytosis: Developed elevated WBC count ___ but without meeting other SIRS and had no other sign of infection. CXR, UA, and cultures were unrevealing of an infectious source and her WBC count trended down. # Hyperglycemia: During her hospitalization she had elevated blood sugars to the 200s. Her A1c was 6.0% as an outpatient. In conjunction with her leukocytosis this was thought to be secondary to a stress reaction after her stroke and her STEMI. She was started on lantus and an insulin sliding scale rather than an oral diabetes medication in anticipation that her elevated blood sugars would resolve over time. TRANSITION OF CARE: - Cardiology: Will require cardiac catheterization when she is able to be anticoagulated, two weeks after her hemorrhagic transformation (___). - Should receive metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tonight, then start metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily tomorrow. - Fluid status and electrolytes: was on furosemide 20 mg daily and KCl 10 mg BID at home; here after acute pulmonary edema required furosemide 20 mg IV daily. After transitioning to oral diet, developed electrolyte abnormalities consistent with dehydration so her lasix was held. Her electrolytes should be monitored daily to determine the appropriate diuretic regimen. AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 1.

We planned to treat this with local thrombolytics, followed by thrombectomy and PTCA +/- stenting. A ___ Hockey stick guide provided modest support. A Prowater wire was advanced into the graft proximal to the thrombus and a 2.0mm balloon was delivered. We injected 3mg tPA through the distal lumen of the balloon x2. Interval angiography revealed no change in antegrade flow. Attempts to deliver an Export catheter were unsuccessful due to lack of guide support. We then performed PTCA with the 2.09x12mm Voyager balloon at 8, 10, and 15atm but again were unsuccessful at restoring antegrade flow. At this point the wire was removed and we exchange for a ___ AL-1 guide which provided much better support. The Prowater wire was again advanced into the native OM vessel. After intra-luminal position was confirmed, we performed at more PTCA with the 2.0mm balloon at 8atm x5 inflations. This improved antegrade flow and revealed some residual thrombus in the mid/distal graft, as well as a stenosis at the distal graft which also involved the previously placed stent (which extended from the distal graft into the native OM. Export thrombectomy was performed x2 runs, followed by PTCA with a 3.5x12mm Voyager balloon at 5 and 8atm. A 3.0x15mm Endeavor was then positioned in overlapping fashion with the prior stent and deployed at 8atm. We post-dilated with the 3.5mm Voyager at 16atm and then with a 3.5x12mm Quantum Maverick at 12atm. Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, TIMI 3 flow, and no apparent dissection.

Selective coronary angiography in this right-dominant system demonstrated native three-vessel disease. The ___ had no angiographically apparent stenosis. The LAD was diffusely diseased with serial 40-50% lesions in its proximal portion and serial 60% lesions in its distal portion. The LCx had a proximal 60% stenosis and a diffusely disease second obtuse marginal with a subtotal occlusion and diffuse disease in its upper pole and serial 70% stenoses in its lower pole. The RCA had diffuse disease with serial 70-80% stenoses. 2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA->LAD to be widely patent. 3. Venous conduit angiography revealed the SVG->OM2 to have a 99% stenosis with diffuse thrombus. The SVG->RCA was not engaged as it was 4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood pressure. 5. Successful PCI of the SVG-OM2 with a 3.0x15mm Endeavor DES, post-dilated to 3.5mm. 6. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a ___ Perclose device. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease. 2. Widely patent LIMA->LAD. 3. Severe stenosis of the SVG->OM2 with diffuse thrombus. 4. Successful PCI of the SVG-OM2 with DES. ___ EKG: Sinus bradycardia. Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction. Prominent QRS voltage suggests left ventricular hypertrophy. Modest inferolateral lead T wave abnormalities are non-specific. Clinical correlation is suggested.

You had a small heart attack and needed a cardiac catheterization. We found many blockages in your heart arteries and you received a total of 7 stents during the course of 2 catheterizations. An echocardiogram showed that your heart is functioning well. Your blood pressure was high so we gave you some intravenous medicine to help lower it. You were confused overnight, perhaps from a sleeping pill called trazadone. Do not take this medicine again. You received a large dose of dye during the catheterizations so we are concerned that your kidney function will worsen. So far, that has not happenend but we will need to follow your kidney function closely after you leave. You will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___. We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. Start taking aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel) daily to keep all the stents open. This is extremely important to prevent another heart attack or even death if the stents suddenly closed. Do not stop taking aspirin and Plavix unless Dr. ___ ___ you it is OK. 2.Start using nitroglycerin if you have any chest pain or trouble breathing similar to the symptoms that preceded your hospitalization. You can take 2 nitroglycerin tablets under your tongue 5 minutes apart. Please call ___ for any pain or severe trouble breathing. 3. Start taking Atorvastatin to lower your cholesterol 4. Start taking Metoprolol to lower your heart rate and blood pressure 5. Start taking Ranitidine to prevent stomach upset from the Plavix and aspirin 6. We increased the dose of your lisinopril from 20mg daily to 40mg daily to help control your blood pressure. **Again, it is very important to have your blood checked on ___ with Dr. ___ to check for your kidney function and electrolytes now that we increased the Lisinopril. You may also need additional blood pressure medication or increased doses. Please discuss this with Dr. ___. ","HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of HTN, hypothyroidism, and GERD, who presents from OSH with history of worsening chest pain, concern for ACS, transferred to ___ for cardiac cath, now s/p 7 BMS to LCx and LAD. Pt is hemodynamically stable, and transferred to CCU for close monitoring. . ACTIVE ISSUES: . # CORONARIES: Differential included ACS vs. demand ischemia ___ uncontrolled HTN. Pt's anginal symptoms seemed to be stable in nature rather than increasing or crescendo in nature to suggest unstable plaque. Pt had been severely hypertensive with LVH findings suggested on ECG. Pt went to cardiac cath with 2 stents initially to LCx; however, pain continued post-procedure, with concern for spasm of left main given elevations in aVR. Pt subsequently had 3 more stents placed to LCx and 2 to LAD. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and peaked post-procedure and down-trended. She was started on ASA 325, Plavix 75mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, and Integrilin for 18hrs. She was started on metoprolol for beta blockade. ACEI was initially held given large dye load and concern for contrast-induced nephropathy. This was restarted as below. TTE demonstrated preserved biventricular systolic function. A1c was sent for risk factor stratification and was 5.9. Lipid panel was sent and showed LDL of 145. She was continued on Atorvstatin 80mg daily. ___ consult was placed. She remained completely chest pain free. She was discharged to continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, Lisinopril and Metoprolol succinate. . # PUMP: No history of heart failure. Pt appeared euvolemic with elevation of JVP and clear lungs. CXR demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary edema. As above, TTE demonstrated preserved systolic function. . # RHYTHM: Initial ECG at OSH and prior to cardiac cath demonstrated shortened PR interval, with question of possible junction rhythm. Repeat ECG's demonstrated sinus rhythm. She was monitored on telemetry without events. . # HTN: Pt presented with hypertensive urgency with SBP to 230 at OSH. On transfer, blood pressure improved from cath, on nitro gtt. She required titration of nitro gtt for control. We were able to wean off the nitro. As above, ACEI was initially held given large dye load and concern for development of contrast-induced nephropathy. She was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg daily. Lisinopril dose was increased to 40mg daily. She was instructed to follow-up with her PCP for further BP management. . # Large dye load: Received 440cc of contrast. Pt was started on IVF due to concern for contrast-induced nephropathy. Cr and lytes were monitored and remained stable without Cr bump. Pt had dark urine on hospital day 2, with RBC's in urine attributed to foley placement, and negative UCx. Urine output remained normal and discoloration resolved. Cr remained normal. As above, ACEI was initially held and restarted prior to discharge. . # Nausea/HA: likely ___ nitro and relatively low BP, and nausea likely also ___ GERD. Resolved after BP better control. Started on H2 blocker for GERD with improved. symptoms. . INACTIVE ISSUES: . # Hypothyroidism: continue home regimen of levothyroxine 25mcg qod. . # GERD: Pt had symptoms prior to admission. She was started Ranitidine 150mg po bid, with improvement of her symptoms. . TRANSITIONAL CARE: 1. CODE: FULL 2. FOLLOW-UP: PCP ___ 3.

Please refer to concurrent chest CT. ___ Dobutamine Stress: INTERPRETATION: ___ yo man s/p MI and and known CAD, systolic and diastolic CHF, aortic stenois and CHF was referred for low dose Dobutamine infusion to evaluate for viability. The patient was administered 5 and 10 mcg/kg/min over 10 minutes (5 min stages). No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported. No significant ST segment changes were noted. The rhythm was sinus with frequent atrial irritability noted throughout; frequent isolated APBs, atrial couplets and atrial triplets. Occasional isolated VPBs were also noted. A flat systolic blood pressure response was noted at the 5 mcg Dobutamine dose with a drop in systolic blood pressure noted at the 10 mcg Dobutamine dose. IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes. Frequent atrial irritability noted throughout (see above). Drop in systolic blood pressure noted at peak infusion. Echo report sent separately. ___ ECHO: The patient received intravenous dobutamine in 5 min (low dose 5mcg/kg/min) and 3 minute stages (>5mcg/kg/min) to a maximum of 10 mcg/kg/min. The test was stopped because the target heart rate was achieved. In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress. Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 64 bpm and a blood pressure of 124/64 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior and apical hypokiensis. The remaining segments contracted well (LVEF = ___ %). There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated critical aortic stenonsis, mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. At low dose dobutamine [5mcg/kg/min; heart rate 71 bpm, blood pressure 124/54 mmHg), there was failure to augment systolic function of all segments. At peak dobutamine stress [10 mcg/kg/min ; heart rate 83 bpm, blood pressure 116/50 mmHg), no new regional wall motion abnormalities were identified. There was no viability suggestede in the infarcted territory. Baseline abnormalities persist.

He denied any arm, neck, back or chest discomfort throughout the test. There were no significant ST segment changes throughout the study. The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy throughout the study. There was an appropriate blood pressure and heart rate response to exercise. . IMPRESSION: No ischemic EKG changes or anginal type symptoms. Echo report sent separately. Echo: The patient exercised for 9 minutes 15 seconds according to a ___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 142 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 156/54 mmHg. The test was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise represents a very good exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress. Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 75 bpm and a blood pressure of 112/60 mmHg. These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. Echo images were acquired within 56 seconds after peak stress at heart rates of 133 - 115 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight decrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. IMPRESSION: Very good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload. Suboptimal study - sub-optimal image quality during post-exercise acquisitions. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> 1. Clopidogrel 75 mg Daily 2. Aspirin 325 mg Daily 3.

There was concern that it was your heart. You also had a bout of indigestion since your last cath. Your bloodwork, EKG and stress echo showed no evidence of a heart attack. . You will be continued on the same medications. You should ask your primary care physician at your appointment on ___ about your cholesterol. In the past, your LDL was noted to be 76. . You have an appointment at the neurology clinic for your foot. They can further evaluate the reason why it's difficult to push off the ground. ","Summary: ___ yo male with a history of CAD (2 DES placed into LAD on ___, hyperlipidemia, HTN, and smoking history presenting with left chest tightness. CORONARIES: The patient has known CAD with a cath report from ___ and an intervention with placement of 2 DES into the proximal and distal LAD (lesions were hazy though FFR showed pressure gradient difference). At that time, he only had single vessel disease. The patient presents with a different type of discomfort than his previous anginal pain. Cardiac enzymes x 3 were normal and there were no EKG changes. The patient did not experience any discomfort during the hospitalization. He was continued on Plavix, high dose aspirin, lisinopril and a statin. A beta blocker was held because he had an adverse reaction to it in the past. Since his discomfort was different than his prior and his last cath was only 2 months ago, it was decided to perform a stress echo on the patient. The stress echo was normal revealing excellent physical endurance and a very good functional exercise capacity without ECG of 2D echo evidence of inducible ischemia. On discharge, the patient was given a prescription for sublingual nitroglycerin. He has a PCP appointment on ___ and ___ planned to have his PCP organize cardiology followup. -follow cardiac enzymes . # Dyslipidemia: From ___ his lipid panel showed LDL calc: 75, HDL: 41, ___: 122, Total choleterol: 122. He was advised to increase his simvastatin 10 mg dose for a goal of LDL<70. On discharge, the patient was given a prescription for pravastatin 20 mg daily because it will provide cost savings. # Left foot drop and associated numbness: The patient complains of difficulty pushing on the ball of his left foot. The physical exam revealed ___ dorsiflexion of the foot and sensory loss on the lateral aspect of the calf wrapping on the the arch of the foot. He did not have any back or neck pain. The remainder of his neurological exam was normal. Since his symptoms are only distal, they might be due to compression of a nerve. He was given an appointment at the neurology urgent clinic for further evaluation. Outpatient followup: 1. Check LDL if at goal 2. Neurology for left foot weakness ",2372,502,13

He presented with persistent left-sided CP in the setting of medication non-compliance. In the ED he received 600mg plavix, 325mg ASA, and was started on a nitro gtt but no heparin due to concerns over previous reports of HIT (though pt was negative for HIT antibody). Troponins were elevated to 0.11 so patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization which showed ""right dominant system demonstrates two vessel coronary disease. The left main and left anterior descending are free of angiographically apparent disease. The right coronary artery is proximally occluded. The circumflex system is involved, with the previously placed stent into the first obtuse marginal upper pole widely patent, which jails a lower pole small vessel (2mm side branch), which is partially occluded with TIMI 1 flow."" There was an ""unsuccessful attempt at PCI of occluded inferior division of first obtuse marginal branch."" Pt's medications were optimized by starting plavix 75mg po daily, starting amlodipine 5mg po daily, and switching simvastatin to lipitor 40mg po daily due to concerns over increased risk of rhabdomyolysis on simvastatin when amlodipine is also used. Continued home aspirin, carvedilol, lisinopril. Cath site was stable and there was no pain, swelling, bruit, or bleeding noted at site. He was satting well on room air on discharge. # ETOH intoxication: pt has a h/o severe etoh abuse and last had drink 14 hours prior to admission to floor consisting of 1L of southern comfort. He was intoxicated on admission to ED with ethanol level of 218. He was placed on a CIWA scale while in house but did not score. Social work was consulted. He was continued on his home magnesium oxide, folic acid, and MVI and also started on thiamine 100mg po daily. On discharge he was recommended to seek treatment for his alcohol abuse. # Mixed cardiomyopathy with EF 25%: likely secondary chronic alcohol abuse. Pt has a h/o V-fib and would likely benefit from an ICD, however, cardiologist has discussed ICD placement with patient and it was determined that pt is a poor candidate due to his continued alcohol abuse and the risk of frequent shocks during etoh withdrawal. He was continued on his home lasix dose in house because he was euvolemic on admission. Cardioprotective regimen optimized as above. # PAF: pt has h/o PAF but was in sinus rhythm on admission and remained in sinus rhythm throughout hospital course. He was monitored on telemetry. He did have frequent PVCs and occasional 3 beat runs of non-sustained v-tach. He remained hemodynamically stable. Not on coumadin - pt has poor medication compliance - but was on aspirin on admission. If patient's medication compliance improves, he would benefit from coumadin due to his CHADS2 score of 2. # HTN: continued patient's current regimen of carvedilol, lasix, lisinopril # HLD: continued simvastatin in house, but due to addition of amlodipine to cardiac regimen, he was switched to lipitor 40mg po daily on discharge to avoid increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when combining these meds. # tobacco abuse: applied nicotine patch ",2718,843,13

An EKG and lab tests were performed that showed you were NOT having a heart attack. You did have a CT scan that showed narrowings in the arteries in your heart (the coronary arteries). For this reason you underwent a cardiac catheterization. This provided more detail about your coronary arteries. You had a total blockage in one of your coronary arteries that was not able to be opened. You also had some lesser narrowings in your other coronary arteries. You will need intensive medical therapy to prevent you from having a heart attack in the future. The most important thing that you can do for your health is to quit smoking. Other important factors are controlling your blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol, which you are doing a good job with currently with your existing medications. No changes were made to your medications at this time. No heavy lifting with the arm used for the catheterization for 7 days. It is important that you go to all follow-up appointments as described below. ","Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with obesity, DM, HLD, HTN, and tobacco use who p/w left sided chest pain, with coronary CTA showing 3-vessel disease (calcium score 2646). . ACTIVE ISSUES: # Chest Pain/Coronary Artery Disease: In the ED the patient was ruled out for acute MI with EKG and biomarkers. He was then enrolled in the ROMICAT II study and received coronary CTA. CTA showed 3-vessel disease (calcium score 2646). He then underwent cardiac cath which showed chronic total occlusion of RCA that could not be opened. The current plan is for maximal medical therapy including smoking cessation. 20 minutes were spent with patient and wife counseling about smoking cessation. He will continue aspirin 81mg, metoprolol succinate 50mg daily, lisinopril 10mg daily, and simvastatin 40mg. There was no room to uptitrate BB or ACEi with current blood pressures. He will follow-up with ___ in cardiology in ___. He was chest pain free for over 48 hours prior to discharge. If he develops refractory symptoms on maximal medical therapy a more aggressive attempt at PCI of RCA could be considered in the future. . CHRONIC ISSUES: # T2DM (HbA1C 6.0): He will continue his current outpatient regimen which includes metformin, actos, glyburide, and januvia. . # HTN: He will continue BB, ACEi . # HLD: His LDL is 65 which is at goal. He will continue Simvastatin 40mg and omega 3 fatty acids . # B12 deficiency: He will continue previous dose of cyanocobalamin . # GERD: He will continue home dose of ranitidine and omeprazole .

No confluent consolidation is identified. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___: Coronary angiography: right dominant LMCA: The LMCA was long but patent. LAD: The LAD was calcified proximally and had mild plaquing just before D1. There was a patent stent in the mid LAD just after D1. There was 40% stenosis just after the stent and prior to an intramyocardial segment with slightly slow flow. The distal LAD wrapped around the apex. LCX: There was a proximal 40% CX lesion followed by a 70% stenosis just before the large OM1. The AV groove CX was small after OM1. There were serial 70% stenoses in OM2 into two bifurcating LPL terminal branches. RCA: The RCA had diffuse plaquing throughout to 35% with mild calcification and mildly slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. Assessment & Recommendations 1. Moderate single vessel CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis and diffuse slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. 2. Iatrogenic systemic arterial hypotension without obvious evidence of anaphylactoid reaction after IA TNG and diltiazem with low normal LVEDP and no reported use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Patient's SBP seemed very sensitive to IA and IC TNG. 3. Negative pressure wire evaluation of the serial moderate stenoses in the proximal LCX into OM2 using IC adenosine (measurement obtained twice with identical results, and IV adenosine strongly relatively contraindicated given daily use of inhaled bronchodilators). 4. Routine post-TR Band care. 5. Given symptoms not typical for ischemia and negative pressure wire evaluation of the LCX, would favor aggressive medical therapy with ASA, high dose statin, smoking cessation and long-acting anti-ischemic medication rather than PCI. This is especially true given slow flow consistent with microvascular disease that would not be addressed with PCI of epicardial vessels. 6. D/C cigarettes. 7.

You were admitted to the hospital for cardiac catheterization after experiencing chest pain. We found diffuse atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries but no vessel that could be intervened on with a stent. You do have a stent in your left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery that was done in ___. We recommend that your coronary artery disease is controlled with medications. You will start a new medication called Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate) which is a long-acting anti-ischemic medication. We also changed your cholesterol-lowering medication to Atorvastatin (stop Simvastatin). You will continue taking Aspirin 325mg daily, Metoprolol tartrate 50mg twice a day, and Ramipril 5mg daily. In addition, stopping smoking would be most beneficial for your heart and overall health. Please discuss with your cardiologist (Dr. ___ about whether or not you should restart Plavix. You did well after cardiac cathterization and you also had no pain, numbness or tingling in your right wrist. Please follow up with your Primary Care Provider and ___ within two weeks of discharge. ","___ male with CAD s/p MI and PCI with bare metal stent placement in LAD in ___ at ___ in ___, current 1.5 ppd smoker, emphysema, and Hashimoto's disease who presented with atypical chest pain symptoms of intermittent sharp substernal chest pain that radiates posteriorly to upper back and lasting 5 seconds maximum but increasing in frequency. Patient endorsed increasing dyspnea on exertion, nausea, and diaphoresis. Extensive coronary artery calcification, mainly involving the LAD, found incidentally on CT trachea on ___. While patient had atypical chest pain symptoms and negative troponin x3, he is high-risk (CAD, current smoker, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and reported that prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, and dyspnea on exertion were similar to prior presentation for MI. Therefore, decision made to proceed with cardiac catheterization. Catheterization done through right radial approach. There were serial moderate stenoses in the LCX; pressure wire evaluation negative. Single vessel CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis and diffuse slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. Given that patient's symptoms not typical for ischemia and negative pressure wire evaluation of the LCX, aggressive medical therapy was indicated rather than PCI, especially given slow flow consistent with microvascular disease that would not be addressed with PCI of epicardial vessels. Patient was therefore continued on high-dose ASA, high-dose statin, ACEI, beta-blocker, and addition of long-acting anti-ischemic medication. Patient was also counseled on smoking cessation to decrease his cardiac risk factors. Patient was clinically stable for discharge on HD#2 with close follow up by Primary Care Provider and ___ (Dr. ___. We switched his statin to Atorvastatin 80mg daily to optimize cholesterol lowering efficacy. We also added Isosorbide mononitrate 30mg daily for coronary artery disease. He will continue taking ASA 325mg daily, Metoprolol tartrate 50mg BID, and Ramipril 5mg daily. Of note, CT trachea on ___ showed solid nodule in the left kidney space of unknown significance.

You were admitted to ___ ___ for evaluation and treatment of chest pain. You were found to have had a recent major heart attack with a decrease in your heart function as well as a blood clot in your heart. You underwent coronary catheterization with placement of a stent in the artery of your heart to open it up. You were started on several new medications to help decrease your risk of further heart attacks. After your heart attack and after the stent was placed, you suffered a cardiac arrest twice. Your heart started beating very fast and irregularly, which caused loss of blood pressure for a few minutes and you required chest compressions and shock to get your heart back into normal rhythm. This is an occasional complication of large heart attacks called ventricular arrhythmia. You were cared for in the ICU for a few days and you had an ICD (defibrillator) placed in your heart to help treat this arrhythmias if they were to happen again. The following changes were made to your medications: START TAKING THE FOLLOWING: Aspirin 81 mg daily Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg daily for your stent Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 80 mg daily for your cholesterol Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily for high blood pressure Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily for your heart Mexiletine 150 mg PO Q12H for your irregular heart beat Warfarin 5 mg daily to break down the clot in your heart. Dr. ___ adjust this dose at follow-up you should get you blood drawn on ___ to check the level of warfarin. It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital! ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of untreated hypertension and tobacco use previously discharged from the ED 2 weeks ago for chest pain with an exercise stress test that reproduced his angina but was without ischemic changes who was admitted with anterior STEMI. He underwent cath with placement of ___ 1 to proximal LAD but post-cath course complicated by vfib arrest x2 with successful resuscitation and systolic heart failuer w/ EF of 30% now s/p single chamber ICD placement. ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: ----------------- #Vfib Arrest: Patient underwent stenting for STEMI with one DES placed to the proximal LAD on ___. Post-cath he remained chest pain free. However, on the evening of ___ he suffered a vfib arrest on the floor. He underwent 3 cycles of CPR and was defibrillated with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). He was bradycardic in the new perfusing rhythm and recieved epinephrine and atropine. Within 5 mintues, he then again converted to polymorphic vtach and underwent 2 additional shocks. Between these shocks, he was given a loading dose of amiodarone 150 mg x1 and then after the repeated vtach he was also started on a lidocaine drip at 1 mg/min without loading dose. After ROSC a second time, he was bradycardic and hypotensive with blood pressures down to ___. He was started on norepinephrine for hypotension and phenylephrine was added when he was still hypotensive. He was transferred to the CCU. In the CCU, he was further loaded with amiodarone for a total loading dose of 450 mg and started on an amiodarone drip with 1 mg/min for the first 6 hours then decreased to 0.5 mg/min for ___ hours and then amiodarone was discontinued completely. His lidocaine drip was continued at the same dosing for 36 hours. The 2 pressors were able to be weaned off within 8 hours. He underwent cardiac cath which was negative for in-stent restenosis or other significant lesions. Ultimately, it was decided that he suffered reperfusion arrhthymia and thus placement of an ICD was not indicated during this hospitalization. Once his blood pressure recovered, his lidocaine drop was stopped and he was restarted on his lisinopril and metoprolol for new onset heart failure post-MI. On the evening of ___, he again suffered ventricular fibrillation arrest. He again received 3 direct cardioversions and returned to sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy. He was placed back on lidocaine drip with resolution of ectopy. Mexilitine was started and he continued to have some ectopy but was monitored for 48 hours off of lidocaine and had no additional episodes of Vtach. He had a repeat TTE on ___ which showed persistent depressed EF of 30% and given his vfib arrest outside of the 48hrs post MI it was felt that he would benefit from an ICD placement, which was placed on ___ without complications. . # Anterior STEMI s/p ___ 1 to Proximal LAD: Patient was admitted with 3 weeks of intermittent anginal chest pain with recent ED observation with ___ with enzymes, serial EKG's, and a moderate risk exercise EKG stress test. He presented to his PCP with ___ in his precordial leads and was sent to the ED where code STEMI was called and patient went to cath lab with ___ 1 placed due to 95% proximal LAD lesion. Per history, it seemed that the worst of his symptoms occurred 5 days PTA and he remained with ___ in V1-V3 following the cath lab. He underwent TTE which showed LV thrombus, LVEF of 35% and mid anterior, mid anteroseptal, distal LV and apical akinesis. His persistent ___ were felt to be c/w aneurysm. His peak trop was 1.42 although during this hospitalization he did not ___ suggesting his insult occurred days prior to his hospitalization. On the floor he was chest pain free and managed post-cath with aspirin 325mg PO daily, prasugrel 10mg PO daily which was switched to clopidogrel 75mg daily given need for warfarin for LV thrombus (see below), metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID, atorvastatin 80mg PO daily, and lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily. # LV Thrombus: Newly diagnosed following recent anterior/apical STEMI. He was started on a heparin drip as well as coumadin with plan to bridge for 24 hours once therapeutic. He will need to be on coumadin for at least ___ months. # Alcohol Dependence: Patient with ___ drinks of hard whiskey daily. Denies history of withdrawal. Did not score on CIWA while in-house and did not require valium. .

You were admitted to ___ for evaluation and treatment of a heart attack. Your course was complicated by an abnormal heart rhythm and cardiac arrest. You were successfully resuscitated. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed multi-vessel disease with acute blockage of one of the arteries of your heart which cause your heart attack. The blockage was removed and a bare metal stent was placed to keep the vessel open. . Your blood pressure were a little low during this admission but you did not have significant symptoms and were able to walk with the nurses and physical therapy without significant difficutly. . Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. . The following changes have been made to your medications: - STOP Tamsulosin as this can lower your blood pressure - STOP Ibuprofen as this can increase your risk of bleeding when getting aspirin and plavix - START Metoprolol Succinate 12.5mg by mouth once daily (take this at night) - START Lisinopril 2.5mg by mouth once daily (take this in the morning) - START Plavix 75mg by mouth once daily (Do not stop taking this medication unless told by a cardiologist) - START Atorvastatin 80mg by mouth once daily - CHANGE Aspirin to 325mg by mouth once daily . Please follow-up with the appointments below. ","___ yo male with CHF/CAD, moderate MR, and HLD presents with inferior/lateral STEMI who coded for vfib arrest in the OSH ED, rec'd chest compressions, and vfib resolved s/p export thrombectomy and BMS to mid RCA admitted to the CCU for hypotension following the procedure. . ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: . # CAD/STEMI/Vfib Arrest c Resuscitation: Mr. ___ presented to an OSH ED 2 days following development of epigastric pain after a period of exertion. Per report he suffered from a vfib arrest, had chest compressions, and reverted to afib with RVR on monitor. He was given a lidocaine bolus and started on lidocaine, heparin, and integrillin drips, given an ASA and transferred to ___ for further evaluation and treatment. He was taken to the cath lab where he received a loading dose of plavix and found was noted to have 2 vessel disease with a thrombotically occluded RCA and a 60% diffusely occluded LAD. He had export thrombectomy and BMS to RCA. He was given dilt in the cath lab for a wide complex tachycardia which broke. He was transferred to the CCU with hypotension and required gentle dopamine pressor support and IV fluid boluses to maintain a MAP >50 which was weaned and discontinued after 2 days. He was monitored on telemetry and evidence of ectopy ceased 72 hours following cath. He had a TTE which showed LVEF 30% secondary to extensive severe inferior posterior and lateral wall hypokinesis/akinesis and RV with free wall hypokinesis. He was started on 2.5mg lisinopril daily (should be given in the morning), 12.5mg metoprolol succinate (which should be given in the evening), 80mg atorvastatin daily, and continued on plavix 75mg and ASA 325mg. We would consider adding spironolactone as a part of his CHF regimen but defer this until later assessment of recovery of LV/RV function by TTE in ___ weeks. . # Afib with RVR: Pt with new afib, likely related to the ___ period. CHADS score 3. On aspirin and plavix and has history of recent falls without intracranial hemorrhage. We deferred initiation of coumadin anti-coagulation in favor of monitoring for resolution of afib following the ___ period. . CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: . # HLD: Stable. Continued on atorvastatin 890mg PO daily . # BPH: Stable. We held his tamsulosin given his relative hypotension but continued his home finasteride. He did not have issues with urinary obstruction during his hospitalization. . # Hypothyroidism: Per report, not on synthroid, thyroid studies wnls. This should be followed as an outpatient. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: . # He is relatively hypotensive with blood pressure ranges of 70's-100's/40's-50's. Unclear if this is new for him and related to decreased cardiac output from his MI. He denies symptoms such as light-headedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or orthostatic symptoms even while at these pressures and was able to walk with physical therapy without significant issues. . # He could likely benefit from some fine-tuning of his CHF regimen as an outpatient but this must be balances against his relative hypotension and his advanced age. This may require repeat TTE in ___ weeks to assess recovery of his LVEF and myocardial function. . # He was full code during this admission . # He was discharged to rehab for continue working on his strength and physical conditioning.

On the way home in the car, around 5: 30pm, she was in the passenger seat trying to talk to her step daughter when she noticed that she wasn't making words that she wanted to say. She was trying to talk but thinks only nonsensical sounds were coming out. They made it home and she was able to carry one of the shopping bags into the house. She continued to have decreased verbal output but started to be able to make some words. Her step daughter became concerned and asked ""what is wrong"" to which she replied ""i don't know."" She then was able to ask her stepdaughter for a glass of orange juice at which point she feels that all her symptoms resolved. She did not have any numbness, tingling, weakness, vertigo.

Coronary angiography: right dominant system LMCA: There were minimal luminal irregularities in the LMCA with mild proximal plaquing to 25% at its origin. LAD: The branching S3 had a proximal 50% stenosis. The mid LAD had a 40% stenosis at D1. There was a 40% bifurcation lesion just after the origin of the tortuous branching D2. The distal LAD was tortuous with a corkscrew configuration with TIMI 2 slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. LCX: The LCX supplied a small high branching OM1 and a branching OM2 that arose in the proximal-mid portion of the LCX. The proximal CX had a 25% stenosis. There was no LCX perfusion of the basal posterolateral left ventricle. RCA: The RCA was a large vessel with a proximal calcified 40% stenosis at its first bend. There was diffuse plaquing to 20% in the mid RCA. There was TIMI 2 flow in the RCA proper. All the terminal branches were serpiginous, consistent with hypertensive heart disease. There were twin RPDAs, with a larger first RPDA with a distal bifurcation followed by a ___ RPDA with a proximal bifurciation. RPL1 was of modest caliber but long. RPL2 was a large tortuous vessel. RPL3 was large at its origin, but had an abrupt reduction in size proximally with a 75% stenosis and slow flow in the small caliber vessel beyond with TIMI 1 flow. RPL4 was tortuous with its distal branch perfusing the high lateral left ventricle. Interventional details Given the ongoing chest pain at the start of the procedure, it was elected to proceed with balloon angioplasty of the RPL3 (although there was clearly insufficient run-off to accommodate a stent). A 6 ___ JR4 guide was substituted, with provided adequate support. Bivalirudin was given with confirmation of a therapeutic ACT. A Prowater wire was manipulated after some effort into RPL3 and after slight additional effort into the distal portion of RPL3. The wire was occlusive across the culprit lesion. The proximal RPL3 was dilated with a 1.5x10 mm Sprinter balloon at 8 atms twice for 60 seconds each. Final angiography showed a 60% stenosis in the proximal RPL3, improved/larger caliber of the mid portion of RPL3, with a distal wire-induced grade C deep dissection/contained perforation at the terminal end of RPL3, without angiographic evidence of free flow into the pericardium. There was TIMI 2 flow into both the RCA proper and RPL. Bivaluridin was discontinued. The angiograms were reviewed with Dr. ___ Dr. ___, as well as with Dr. ___ ___ Dr. ___ the ___. The patient was pain free at the conclusion of the procedure. A Terumo Radial Band was applied to the right radial artery with good hemostasis. Potential for Radiation Injury This patient underwent a procedure performed under fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance. Procedures involving lengthy exposures to X-rays may cause damage to the skin and/or hair. These adverse effects may be increased if one has had previous (especially recent) radiation exposure to the same skin area. Radiation injury to the skin can take many forms, including an area of redness, blistering, hair loss, or ulceration. These effects may appear after a few weeks or even after several months. If an of these occur on the side and back of the torso (or elsewhere), please contact the Interventional Cardiology Section at ___ to arrange further evaluation. Assessment & Recommendations 1. Two vessel branch coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis and diffuse slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction in a system with a hyperdominant RCA. 2. Tortuous terminal vessels consistent with hypertensive heart disease. 3. Normal left ventricular diastolic function. 4. Unsuccessful balloon angioplasty of the RPL3 with residual stenosis of 60% and a distal guide-wire induced grade C dissection vs. contained perforation. 5. Routine post-TR Band care. 6. D/C bivalirudin. 7. Cycle CKMB, platelets. 8. Low threshold for bedside TTE and consideration of pericardiocentesis for tamponade if patient becomes hypotensive tonight. Recurrent chest pain could represent abrupt closure of RPL3 or pericardial hemorrhage. Despite poor angioplasty result, would not treat with GP IIb/IIIa or heparin given distal wire dissection vs. contained perforation. 9. Reassess benefits vs. risks of clopidogrel as medical therapy for NSTEMI after unsuccessful balloon angioplasty tomorrow. 10. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against hypertension, CAD and NSTEMI Attending Electronic Signature attests that the attending physician was physically present during the key components of the procedure and in compliance with the CMS regulations. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

You had chest pain and 2 blockages in your right coronary artery. These arteries were opened in the cardiac catheterization lab and 2 drug eluting stents were placed to keep the arteries open. There does not seem to be any damage to your heart muscle. You will need to take new medicines to minimize the risk of another blockage in your arteries. new Medicines: 1. Start taking Aspirin 325 mg (not baby) and Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg every day for at least one year to prevent the stents from clotting off. ___ not stop taking these medicines or miss any doses unless Dr. ___ tells you to. This is extremely important to prevent any heart damage. 2. Start taking Simvastatin to lower your cholesterol. You will need to have a cholesterol level and liver function tests done in about 6 weeks to check the response to this medicine. 3. Start taking Lisinopril for your high blood pressure. This medicine may make your potassium higher and cause you to feel dizzy. You should get your labs checked next week and take your blood pressure every day so the medicine can be adjusted. 4. continue to take Zantac as needed for your heartburn. ___ not take any medicines like Prilosec as these can interfere with the function of the Plavix. 5. Nitroglycerin: to take if you have chest pain at home, take one tablet under your tongue, wait 5 minutes and take one more tablet. If you still have chest pain call ___.

This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency. . ACTIVITY: . There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your transmetatarsal amputation you are non weight bearing for ___ weeks. You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever possible. . You may use the heel of your amputation site for transfer and pivots. But try not to exert to much pressure on the site when transferring and or pivoting. If possible avoid using the heel of your amputation site when transferring and pivoting. . No driving until cleared by your Surgeon. . PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS: . Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s). . New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes. . Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR. . Exercise: . Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. . Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon. . No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days. . Try to keep leg elevated when able. . BATHING/SHOWERING: . You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A dressing may cover youre amputation site and this should be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your ___ appointment. . WOUND CARE: . Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for staple removal. . When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower. . Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery. . MEDICATIONS: . Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary. . Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small balanced meals throughout the day. CAUTIONS: . NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking cessation. . Avoid pressure to your amputation site. . No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery. . DIET: . There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred. . For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred or get a referral from your doctor. . If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight management program. Your health and its improvement depend on it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get a referral from your doctor. . If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor. ___ APPOINTMENT: . Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated! . Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a ___ visit. This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge.

Normal biventricular diastolic function. CT Abd/pelvis Noncon ___ CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Lung bases are clear without consolidation or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal without pericardial effusion. Dense calcification of the coronary arteries is noted. In the abdomen, assessment of solid organs is limited in the absence of IV contrast. However, the liver is grossly unremarkable. A focal hypodensity anteriorly is unchanged and likely represents focal fatty infiltration. A small gallstone is present in a decompressed gallbladder. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are grossly unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney. Perinephric stranding size is unchanged. The stomach and duodenum are distended with fluid and small amount of ingested material. The esophagus also contains fluid. There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen. The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcification, but is normal in caliber. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by size criteria. CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Large bowel demonstrates residual oral contrast material, possibly from the CT of ___ or from an outside hospital study. Loops of small bowel are distended, extending to the distal small bowel. Both small and large bowel extends into a large, wide-based ventral hernia. A transition in small bowel caliber is noted just adjacent to the ventral hernia, with a small segment of fecalization of contents of the dilated small bowel, measuring up to 4 cm. Distally, there is marked decompression of the distal and terminal ileum. The colon is relatively decompressed, although still retained a small amount of stool and contrast material. There is no extraluminal fluid or air. The sigmoid colon demonstrates scattered diverticulosis without diverticulitis. There is no free fluid layering dependently in the pelvis. The urinary bladder contains excrete contrast material. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria. A fem-fem bypass graft is in place. The patient has undergone prior low anterior resection and surgical material is present at the rectosigmoid junction. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are present throughout the lower spine, with no interval change. There is no new fracture. IMPRESSION: 1. High-grade small-bowel obstruction, with dilatation of proximal loops up to 4 cm, and complete decompression of the distal and terminal ileum. Obstruction may be early, as there is residual oral contrast and stool within the colon, which is minimally decompressed. No evidence of perforation. Obstruction occurs adjacent to the mouth of the large ventral hernia. However, both dilated and decompressed loops pass into and out of the hernia sac. Obstruction may be related to adhesions. 2. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 3. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 4. No evidence of obstruction at the rectosigmoid anastomosis. 5. Atherosclerotic disease. ___ abd x-ray Single supine portable abdomen radiograph was obtained. The radiograph demonstrates focal mild dilatation of small bowel loops in the epigastric region measuring 3.2 cm, consistent with the small bowel loops seen within the ventral hernia on the prior CT scan. Air is seen within the descending colon and the rectum. The relative lack of air in the distal small bowel suggests likely partial or early small bowel obstruction. There is no intraperitoneal free air. The NG tube terminates at the gastroesophageal junction, and the sideholes likely are at the distal esophagus. Recommended advancement of the NG tube. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings suggestive of early/partial small bowel obstruction. 2. Recommended further advancement of the NG tube.

He received a CT ABD with contrast that was negative for SBO at that time. On ___ he complained of abdominal pain that passed with ativan and simethicone. On ___ he had constipation, ___ he had obstipation, bilious emesis and acute renal failure. A NGT was placed. Surgery was consulted. All PO only medications were held except for Plavix which was given down the NGT. Surgery followed and his NGT drainage decreased and he started to have BMs on ___. On ___ the NGT was pulled. Mr. ___ then had intermittent nausea without vomiting which resolved with Ranitidine. He continue to have BMs and flatus. # ARF: On ___ he developed ARF in the setting of SBO. Patient made very little urine and was therefore transfered to a MICU for management of fluid status given ARF and Aortic stenosis. IVF were started and a foley catheter was placed which was subsequently removed with voiding prior to discharge. His creatinine at d/c was 1.2, at his baseline. # Respiratory failure/ COPD Patient with known history of COPD, Asthma, and OSA as well as an extensive smoking history. He is on 2L of continuous O2 as well as Albuterol, Advair, and Tiotropium at home and over the past 3 months has required multiple intubations for respiratory distress despite repeated courses of Prednisone & antibiotics, most recently approximately 2 weeks PTA. He was intubated on ___ at ___ for an ABG of 7.___/62/32 and was extubated on ___ AM to CPAP prior to transfer after improved respiratory status. Etiology likely obstructive lung disease with systolic CHF as patient did not demonstrate e/o infection. In the CCU, the patient was placed on BIPAP and eventually weaned to 2L of NC over approximately 24 hours. He received 40 mg of Prednisone daily and a course of levaquin. By ___, he was on 2 litres, saturating at 97%. He was able to tolerate room air with good saturations on day of discharge. He was discharged with a slow steroid taper. # Systolic Heart Failure Diasolic Heart Failure Aortic Stenosis, Severe Aortic Insufficiency Patient with known systolic heart failure, last EF in ___ demonstrated EF 45-50% with severe AS (mean gradient 47 mm Hg and area 0.8cm^2) and ___ AR. His EF is unchanged from echocardiograms, but as his AR has progressed significantly since his last echo one month prior, his true forward flow is likely more compromised than his EF would suggest. CXR's from OSH have not demonstrated e/o congestion or effusions and clinical exam does not support fluid overload, but pBNP was elevated at 3969. Patient possibly a candidate for percucanteous valve replacement vs valvuloplasty however this decision will be deferred to the outpatient setting. # CORONARIES: Patient s/p CABG ___ (LIMA -> LAD, SVG -> D2, OM2, RCA; stent to RCA graft ___. His last cardiac catheterization in ___ demonstrated three vessel coronary disease with a patent LIMA, but occlusion of all vein grafts. Patient with possible old inferior MI based on micro-Q waves in II, III, AvF, but EKG on admission does not demonstrate new ST changes. CE's trended down from OSH levels (peak CK 229) and patient was CP free. Patient initially on Heparin gtt, ASA, statin, beta-blocker. He did not receive Plavix at OSH as he has a history of GI bleed and thrombocytopenia while on Plavix. He was discharged with the addition of Plavix and high-dose statin with high-dose aspirin. # RHYTHM: Patient without known history of arrythmia, but micro-Q waves in II, III, and AvF suggest prior inferior infarct not seen on ECG from ___. # Hypertension: Patient takes Imdur SR 120 mg daily & Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg TID at home. Blood pressures at OSH and in CCU were well-controlled. Given h/o AS, patient likely pre-load dependent. Imdur and Metoprolol were restarted before discharge. # Hyperlipidemia: Patient takes Simvastatin 20mg qHS at home. Given question of ACS, high dose statin warranted. Fish oil was also continued. # Alcohol abuse: Patient with extensive EtOH history and an episode of DT in ___ requiring intubation. His EtOH screen on ___ at ___ was negative and his wife reported that his last drink was on ___. Patient was maintained on a CIWA scale and continued to get his home q8H prn Ativan for anxiety. # Anxiety: Patient with h/o anxiety, on Celexa 80mg daily, Lorazepam 1mg TID:PRN, and Seroquel 12.5mg BID at home. Per OMR records, patient preferred not to take Seroquel out of concern for side effects, so it is unlikely to be an active medication. Home medications were continued. # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient with known PAD s/p LLE Fem-Pop bypass (unclear when). He also has a known ascending aortic aneurysm last measured at 4.2cm x 4.2cm in ___. ASA 325 and Pentoxyfylline SR 400mg TID were continued. # Anemia: Patient with known Vitamin B-12 deficiency anemia for which he receives daily supplementation. Iron studies during this hospitalization were normal and he was continud on his home B-12 1,000 mcg daily. # GERD: Patient was continued on his home Omeprazole 20mg daily and then was switched to an H2B before discharge. Ranitidine worked better than Famotidine. # H/o recurrent C. difficile colitis: Patient has failed multiple Flagyl regimens in the past in the context of EtOH use, and was ultimately successfully treated with an extended course of Vancomycin. He did have an episode of diarrhea and abdominal pain during this hospitalization which resolved. He had multiple bowel movements after resolution of his SBO, likely thought to be due to just improved motility. # H/o Colon cancer: s/p sigmoid colectomy w/ colorectal anastomosis ___ and adjuvant Xeloda therapy with resulting post-surgical anterior wall abdominal hernia. Patient uses belt for hernia control, but this has exacerbated SOB in the past, so it was not utilized during this hospitalization. # Active smoking habit: Patient smokes ~ 1ppd with >150 pack year history. He was given a Nicotine TD during this hospitalization and provided an Rx and counseling prior to discharge.

Secondary diagnosis: coronary artery disease type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension hyperlipidemia anxiety post-traumatic stress disorder <DISCHARGE CONDITION> afebrile, hemodynamically stable <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to the hospital after you had a cardiac arrest at home. You were found to have a very serious arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation), for which you received electric defibrillation shock before arriving to the hospital. At the hospital, you were evaluated and treated with cardiac catheterization and stenting for coronary artery disease. You were observed in the intensive care unit and were found to have a stroke most likely due to cholesterol-plaques dislodged from the electric shock during resuscitation. Your hospital course was also complicated by respiratory failure, for which you were intubated, aspiration pneumonia, which we treated with antibiotics. Because of the extremely high risk of developing a lethal arrhythmia again, an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. . We recommend that you follow up with your physicians very closely (see below). We recommended that you go to rehabilitation after discharged from the hospital, however, you refused to go. Therefore, if you go home, you should restart your activities very carefully and have somebody with you at all times, given your severe medical conditions and very high risk of fall and injury. You should not drive and should not perform any major activity by yourself, unless you talk to a physician. . Your medications have been changed as follows: - we stopped your lamotrigine (lamictal) while you were in the hospital and we recommend that you talk to your psychiatrist before restarting it - started you on aspirin 325mg PO daily and clopidogrel 75mg PO daily, please do not stop taking these medications unless directed to do so by your cardiologist - started atorvastatin 80mg PO daily for your lipid control - started metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily for your heart disease - started lisinopril 30mg PO daily for your blood pressure - started hctz 25mg PO daily for your blood pressure - continued metformin 850mg PO BID for your diabetes, please follw up with your physican on how to control your blood sugar optimally - started oxycodone and acetaminophen as needed for pain - started docusate for your bowel movements while on opioid pain killers - started thiamine and folic acid vitamins - started pantoprazole for heart burn - continued lorazepam as needed for anxiety - continued SLNTG as needed for chest pain, please call ___ immediately, if you your chest pain lasts after 3 tablets taken 15 minutes apart. - continued your prednisone taper through ___ - started cephalexin 500mg PO q6h for 3 days after AICD placement - started albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatment . Please stop smoking. Information on smoking cessation was given to you on admission. . Please call your physician immediately if you have fever, headache, new neurological deficits, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other symptoms that concern you. ","In summary, Ms ___ is a ___ y/o F with DM2, HTN, 3vCAD (s/p MI s/p RCA stent in ___, EtOH and tobacco abuse, h/o depression/PTSD, transferred to the ___ on ___ from ___ ___ for VF arrest on ___ s/p electric shock in field. Pt was initially treated in the CCU, then transferred to the MICU for management of respiratory failure, hypertension and newly-diagnosed embolic strokes, and finally transferred to the medicine floor for observation and AICD device placement. . 1) Respiratory failure/Aspiration PNA: The pt initially was difficult to ventilate in the CCU. DDx of resp failure included PE (CTA negative, but did show diffuse b/l pulm infiltrates), COPD (baseline, med non-compliance, wheezes on exam), pneumonia (sputum Cx negative, on Abx), aspiration (pre-/post-cardioversion, radiographic findings suggestive). The pt was empirically treated with steroids out of concern for a COPD flair, as well as nebulizer treatments. In this setting, after several days, her respiratory status finally imporved and she was able to be extubated on ___. Post extubation the pt did very well with minimal oxygen requirements. Her RA O2 sat was 95-100%. Steroid taper was initiated, to be continued through ___. Pt was discharged on home albuterol/ipratropium nebs. . 2) Hypetertension: In the CCU, the pt was intermittently noted to be hypertensive into the 200s- reportedly alternating SBPs from 140s to 320. Alcohol withdrawal considered, as well as RAS (normal renal u/s) and pheochromocytoma (normal torso CT). Repeat CT today showed new embolic infarcts in L occipital lobe, L frontal lobe. Neuro consulted, pt started on nicardipine gtt, pt transferred to MICU for ongoing management of her newly diagnosed stroke, respiratory failure and hypertension. Given her recent CVAs, neuro advised a goal BP of the 140s-160s. In the ICU, the pt was managed with captopril and HCTZ; she briefly required a nicardipine gtt to control her BP. On the floor, her SBPs ranged in the 100-150s range, she was continued on HCTZ 25mg PO daily, lisinopril 30mg PO daily, Toprol XL 25mg PO daily. On discharge, she was normotensive. . 3) Embolic stroke: Head CT for evaluation of HTN on ___ revealed new embolic infarcts in L occipital lobe, L frontal lobe. The findings were confirmed with MRI/MRA. Pt had a h/o CEA in ___ and the neck MRA revealed some narrowing in the R carotid artery, however, the strokes seemed to be of embolic origin given the CAD, presentation, and distribution. They most likely happened in the context of her VFib and defibrillation, as their appearance in the CT scan points towards subacute events. Thus, pt was kept on ASA and clopidogrel, but no anticoagulation was started on discharge. Pt's neurological exam significant for R sided weakness and peripheral vision loss. Sensation grossly intact, ambulation is difficult (rehab was recommended, but pt refused). . 4) Leukocytosis: The pt was noted to have an elevated WBC count over the course of her hospital stay. Given concern for aspiration around the time of the pt's defibrillation in the field, and given radiographic findings consistent with this, the pt was treated with Zosyn for an 8 day course. Her initial treatment at time of presentation also included levofloxacin and vancomycin, however these were stopped based on negative culture results. On transfer to the medicine floor, her WBC count downtrended (31.8--> 15.3, 18.4 on discharge s/p AICD placement). . Note: B-Glucan positive 360 (>80), Galactomannan negative. Tests repeated with similar findings, however fungal blood cx remained negative. Zosyn could give a false positive for galactomannan (which was negative)(N ___ J Med. ___, but this has not been reported for B-glucan (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. ___ 50(10): ___). . 5) CAD/Ischemia: Patient has prior history of inferior MI, with 3VD (diffuse 50% stenosis) on cardiac catheterization performed on day of admission. Cardiac catheterization revealed non-occlusive disease, and picture felt not to be consistent with ACS. Stenting of OM1 undertaken (not felt to be culprit lesion). The pt was continued on ASA 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily. A beta blocker was held in the setting of bronchospams on exam, however low-dose metoprolol was started on ___ppeared to tolerate well. Pt discharged on aspirin, beta-blocker, ace-i, and statin. Given 3vCAD, CABG evaluation in the future is to be considered. Since the stroke seems to have occured in the setting of v-fib/electric defibrillation, it is not thought to be a contra-indication to possible CABG, once pt is medically stabilized and improved. . 6) Arrhythmia/V-fib: Pt was in sinus rhythm with occasional PVC and asymptomatica tachycardic episodes associated with movement.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You had a heart attack and your heart developed a very dangerous rhythm that required defibrillation. You needed a machine to breathe and a machine to keep your heart pumping. You were transferred here for an evaluation for your heart arteries but we decided that this was not a good plan for you right now. You had some extra fluid ___ your lungs and this was removed with medications. You will need to take many new medicines every day to keep your heart beating strong and to prevent the stents ___ your heart artery from clotting off and causing another heart attack or death. The two most improtant medicines are aspirin and Plavix. Do not miss any doses of these medications or stop taking them unless Dr. ___ tells you not to. You will see Dr. ___ ___ 1 week and Dr. ___ ___ one month. You should not drink alcohol at all until you are seen by Dr. ___ are tolerating your medicines. We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. Stop taking Pravastatin, take Atorvastatin instead to lower your cholesterol 2. Start taking aspirin 325 mg and Plavix daily to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack 3. Start taking Metoprolol succinate to slow your heart beat and help your heart pump better 4. STart taking Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure 5. Start taking Tylenol and a lidoderm patch to treat the pain ___ your buttock. You can stop using these once the pain is gone 6. STart taking Benzonatate three times a day for your cough, you can stop taking this once the cough is gone. 7. Start taking ciprofloxacin for your pneumonia for 5 more days 8. STart taking Vitamin B12, folate, thiamine and a multivitamin to correct any nutritional deficiencies. 9. Take famotidine to protect your stomach from the aspirin and Plavix 10. Start taking furosemide to prevent fluid from building up again ___ your lungs. 11. Use nitroglycerin under your tongue if you have any chest pain again. Sit down, take 1 tablet and wait 5 minutes, you can take another tablet if the pain is still there. Call ___ if your chest pain is not gone after 2 tablets. Call Dr. ___ you have any chest pain. . You will need to monitor yourself for fluid buildup ___ your legs or lungs. Weight yourself every day before breakfast, call Dr. ___ you notice that your weight increases more than 3 pounds ___ 1 day or 5 pounds ___ 3 days. Your weight at discharge was 158 pounds. You will need to eat a low sodium diet. Information regarding this was given to you. You had some vascular flow studies to evaluate circulation ___ your leg. This test is still pending today and will need to be followed up by Dr. ___ ___ Instructions: ___","Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old ___-speaking male with PMH of ___ transferred from OSH s/p STEMI c/b Vfib arrest with now with BMS x 2 to LCX, on pressors with IABP placement. #. Cardiogenic shock: He was transferred from OSH with cardiogenic shock (low cardiac index, elevated CVP/ PWP, high SVR, hypotension) requiring pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump. Etiology secondary to STEMI (see below) s/p revascularization with BMS x 2 to left circumflex. During CCU stay, hemodynamics were monitored with aortic ballon pump, arterial line, swan ganz catheter and urine output with goal MAP > 65, UOP 50cc/hr and CVP 12 -14 (higher goal ___ likely RV infarct). While on intra-aortic balloon pump, patient maintained on heparin gtt and monitored for complications. Of note, he did develop mild thrombocytopenia and symptoms worrying for progressive limb ischemia with decreased peripheral pulses and rising CK. As hemodynamics improved dopamine was discontinued and he was weaned off intra-aortic balloon pump. Echocardiogram on ___ while on intra-aortic balloon pump showed EF of 45%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w inferoposterior infarction. Once hypotension had resolved, he was started on metoprolol and captopril and was discharged on ___. #. Coronaries: He presented to OSH with STEMI c/b vfib arrest ___ emergency department. Emergent catheterization at OSH showed severe 2 vessel disease with 100% occlusion ___ left circumflex, 40% mid-LAD disease, sequential 90% proximal 70% distal and 90% ostial RCA lesions. He received BMS x2 to left circumflex at OSH, and was transferred to ___ for possible intervention on RCA. Received ASA 325mg, plavix load of 600mg; and was subsequentially started on ASA 325mg, plavix 75mg, and atorvostatin 80mg. When cardiogenic shock resolved, patient was also started on metoprolol succinate 100mg daily and lisinopril 10mg daily. Patient will need further risk factor modification for secondary prevention with better BP and lipid control. # ___ Cramping/ poor peripheral pulses: On review of symptoms, patient complained of lower extremity cramping with exertion, poor dorsal pedial pulses, and symptoms concerning for lower extremity ischemia upon femoral artery vascular access. ABI showed severe flow deficit of right lower extremity and significant left tibial disease. This will need to followed as an outpatient and referral to vascular surgery may be appropriate. #. s/p endotracheal intubation: Patient was emergently intubated following post-arrest agitation for airway protection; requiring minimal ventilatory support. Following resolution of cardiogenic shock, patient was successfully extubated on ___. Immediately following extubation, patient transientally desaturated to mid ___ from mild pulmonary edema and mucus plugging with possible VAP. Treated successfully with lasix and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Respiratory status improved with lasix and by ___ he was no longer requiring supplemental O2. #. Elevated CK: Upon admission, patient had CK elevated to 2604 which trended up to 8716 during course of hospitalization. Etiology was multifactorial from myocardial infarction, muscle injury from cardiac resuscitation and early lower extremity ischemia during intra-aortic balloon pump placement. Myocardial ischemia was treated as above. CK trended down once balloon pump was removed. Renal function was trended and there was no evidence of myoglobinuria or renal injury associated with elevated CK. #. Fever: on ___, patient developed fever to 101.5. Infectious evaluation with blood culture, urinalysis/ culture, sputum culture and CXR was concerning for ventilator associated PNA. Groin lines (IABP, a-line) also may have been source of infection/ fever. Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime for HAP/ possible line infection. Sputum culture was growing GNR and GPCs. Fever curve and WBC count was trended. #. Transaminitis: Likely shock liver ___ the setting of VF arrest with cardiogenic shock. LFTs trended down thoughout his hospitalization. Patient's underlying alcohol abuse may have also contributed to elevated LFTs. ",3364,972,13

You definitely did NOT have a heart attack, but with the description of your event paired with the imaging results of your head, we cannot say for sure that this was not a transient ischemic attack or TIA. A TIA is like a stroke, but its effects are not permanent, they resolve with time. . To prevent future events like this, we recommend continuing your daily aspirin. You were already taking Simvastatin 40mg and Amlodipine 5mg, but after discharge you should only continue taking the simvastatin as your blood pressure has been good on its own. All of your other home medications can also be continued as prior to admission. . We did a study called an echocardiogram to look in your heart to see if there was a source for the possible TIA there. We found no abnormalities. . Our physical therapists at the hospital evaluated you, and recommended that you be discharged to home, but with outpatient physical therapy visits to make sure that you are regaining your strength and balance. ","This is the brief hospital course of a ___ year-old woman with a past medical history significant for HTN, HLD, arthritis, and CAD who presented with a 1 week history of facial asymmetry and an unsteady gait as well as 1 day of LEFT hand numbness and jaw/chest/arm pain. .

You were admitted because you had a heart attack. You underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed some coronary artery disease. You had 2 stents placed. While you were having stents placed in your coronary arteries, your heart stopped pumping blood. This was fixed with defibrillation (electric shocks to the chest). Additionally, you had an episode of an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (""A fib""), so we will send you home with a monitor to see if you have any further arrhythmias at home. You are now on aspirin. You need to take aspirin everyday. If you stop taking aspirin, you risk for having stent blockage and death. Do not stop taking aspirin unless you are told by your cardiologist. You are now on prasugrel. This medication helps keep your stent open. Do not stop taking this medication unless you are told by your cardiologist. You will need to take this for ___ year. It is critical that you not smoke cigarettes any longer. You will be discharge with nicotine lozenges, but you should talk to your primary care doctor about other options to quit smoking. We wish you all the best, Your ___ Cardiology team ","___ with history of HLD, HTN, tobacco abuse and sleep apnea who presented to ___ on ___ with chest pressure over a few days prior to admission. He was found to have an NSTEMI with inferior q-waves and T wave changes. He was transferred to ___. # CORONARIES: Angiography ___ showed distal RCA occlusion and thrombus in the LMCA, LAD, and 100% ostial LCx occlusion. Kissing drug eluting stents placed at bifurcation of left main coronary artery into LAD and LCX. Residual moderate mid-LAD disease, subtotal occlusion of OM2 and occlusion of distal RCA. RCA was not revascularized. # PUMP: LVEF 55% ___ TTE) > 35% ___ TTE) > 55% ___ TEE) with akinesis of the inferior segments and hypokinesis of the inferolateral segments. There was no ___ on TEE. # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm on admission and discharge; had new atrial fibrillation during his PCI # 3-vessel coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation MI: The patient presented as a transfer from ___ ___ with biochemical evidence of NSTEMI with q-waves inferiorly and T wave changes inferiorly. He was placed on heparin ___ and went for left heart catheterization on ___. During the procedure the RCA was evaluated initially and showed total distal RCA occlusion. Before engaging the LCA, the patient had severe chest pain and started becoming hypotensive. He was started on inopressors and a balloon pump was placed. His left coronary system showed thrombus in the LMCA, LAD, and total ostial occlusion of the LCx. Given the thrombus location in all 3 vessels and cardiogenic shock, the major intervention was placement of ""kissing"" drug-eluting stents to the LMCA at the bifurcation into the LAD and LCx with subsequent improvement in flow. During the procedure the patient had brief atrial fibrillation and then developed VF twice that responded to defibrillation without CPR. It was unclear why he appeared to have active thrombus in all 3 coronary arteries with new thrombi likely occurring during the catheterization. This may have been due to thrombus formation on the catheter, hypercoaguable state, or cardiac thromboembolism to the coronary arteries. He was started on tirofiban given the thrombus burden and transferred to the CCU post-procedure on a balloon pump and off inopressors. He was continued on heparin gtt initially, which was switched to bivalriduin gtt (given c/f drug-related hypercoagulability given appearance of and extent of thrombus found on cath) which was continued for a total of 48hr. Overnight, blood was noted in his IABP line and so IABP was removed. The balloon pump did not appear to be augmenting his MAPs significantly and he did not have hemodynamic issues after removal. After removal of IABP, he continued to do well. And patient was loaded with and continued on ticagrelor. His troponin peaked at 10.8 and CKMB peaked at 387. Patient also had a post-NSTEMI TTE which showed LVEF 35% (no apical akinesis). However, post-catheterization TEE to evaluate for ___ showed EF of 55%. There were moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior segments and hypokinesis of the inferolateral segments. Because TEE was negative for thrombus and patient's transient atrial fibrillation in the cath lab was thought related to catheterization and so decision was made to defer anticoagulation. Repeat TTE ___ showed 45-50% EF with more functional MR, which supported the decision to pursue a second cardiac catheterization. On ___ he had repeat coronary angiography with successful POBA of mid-distal LCX, successful DES 2x of mid & distal RCA. He had severe ostial stenosis of ramus artery at the trifurcation with the prior LMCA>LAD and LMCA>LCx kissing stents that was not intervened upon. He will need a repeat TTE in the next ___ weeks to reevaluate systolic function and mitral regurgitation following revascularization. At discharge, patient was in sinus rhythm and patient was sent home with a monitor to continue to assess for cardiac arrhythmia. Patient was evaluated by ___ and outpatient cardiac rehab was recommended. #sCHF: Post-NSTEMI TTE demonstrated LEVF 35% with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and akinesis of the inferior segments and hypokinesis of the inferolateral segments likely secondary to CAD. No ___. However, TEE showed improvement of EF to 55% one day later. Patient was started on low dose lisinopril of 2.5mg daily and metoprolol succinate 50mg daily for heart failure with plans to uptitrate as tolerated by BPs. #New AF: No prior history of AF. Occurred transiently in the setting of ischemia in the cath lab. He was otherwise in sinus rhythm. Most likely a result of extreme catecholaminergic tone during cath, especially given electrical and hemodynamic instability. No AF on telemetry after leaving cath lab. CHADS2=1. Decision made not to systemically anticoagulate. Patient was continued on metoprolol 12.5mg TID initially and transitioned to 50mg XL prior to discharge home. Patient was also discharged with an event monitor to assess for further dysrhythmias. #Cardiogenic shock: Required 2 pressors in the cath lab and IABP, but pressure improved after placement of stents to LMCA>LCx and LMCA>LAD. Initially arrived with IABP, which was removed shortly therafter ___ blood in the helium gas line (c/f balloon rupture). Patient continued to do well off the balloon pump and was able to be weaned off pressors within the next ___ hr. #VF arrest: Occurred x2 in the cath lab. Likely ischemic. TTE prior to cath had EF 55% with hypokinesis of the basal-mid inferior wall and basal inferoseptal walls suggestive of prior MI (q-waves on ECG). As his EF was normalized on discharge and he was considered low likelihood for subsequent sudden cardiac arrest after partial revascularization, no ICD/lifevest was indicated. Patient sent home with an event monitor to assess for dysrhythmia. ================= CHRONIC ISSUES: ================= #Tobacco abuse: Long-standing smoker, though had quit once in past and started smoking again during divorce. Patient is now very motivated to quit again. He was given nicotine gum and encouraged to quit smoking. ___ consider for varenicline or bupropion as outpatient. #HTN: Held HCTZ. He was started on metoprolol succinate and lisinopril. These should be up-titrated as hemodynamics allow. #HLD: Started atorvastatin 80mg daily. #OSA: continued CPAP at home setting of 13 cm H20 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -DISCHARGE WEIGHT: 131.6 kg (discharged off diuretics) -Discharged with ___ of Hearts Event monitor to evaluate for atrial fibrillation (his original, transient post-arrest rhythm) -continue Prasugrel 10 mg PO DAILY minimum x12 months -continue aspirin for life -please uptitrate lisinopril as tolerated by BPs -patient needs referral for outpatient cardiac rehab -consider repeat TTE in ___ weeks to evaluate stability of EF -discharged off diuretics given stability/euvolemia while inpatient. Consider reevaluation for diuretic as an outpatient. ",3769,1662,13

It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___! We wish you all the best! - Your ___ Care Team WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL? -You were admitted to the hospital because you had a heart attack (non-ST elevlation myocardial infarction) and needed to have a stent placed. WHAT WAS DONE WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL? -A procedure called a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where xrays are used to look at the blood vessels around your heart was completed. A stent was placed in one of your arteries in order to open a blockage that was seen and to improve the blood flow to your heart. -You were started on a medication called ticagrelor which is essential to take for at least one month until you follow up with your cardiologist to make sure that the stent remains open. -Your home medication labetalol was increased to help better control your blood pressure. -You were given a prescription for a medication called nitroglycerin which can be taken on an as needed basis to help with chest pain. -We have asked that you temporarily stop taking your lisinopril until you see your nephrologist to make sure that your kidney function is back to where it was prior to the hospitalization. Please monitor your urine output and if it decreases please call your PCP as soon as possible to be evaluated. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below). It is very important that you take your aspirin and ticagrelor (Brilinta) EVERY DAY. - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop chest pain, are unable to urinate, develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night.

You initially went to the hospital because you were having chest pain. This was found to be due to a heart attack, which is also called a myocardial infarction (MI). You were taken for cardiac catheterization where you had a blockage in one of the arteries in your heart. This blockage was opened using a stent. It is VERY important that you take a baby aspirin (81mg) EVERY day. This is to prevent you from having another heart attack. In addition you will need to take a medication called plavix for the next month. This medication is important for keeping the stent from closing off. You were started on several different medications during this hospitalization. You were started on a medication called metoprolol. This medication lowers you blood pressure and also helps protect your heart. You were started on a medication called atorvastatin which lowers your cholesterol and also helps protect your heart. In addition it was found that your diabetes has progressed and you will need medication in addition to improving your diet and exercise. Controlling your blood sugar is important for decreasing your risk of kidney disease and other complications. You will need to make an appointment with a primary care provider (PCP). This person will be a general doctor who will oversee your medical care. This person will help treat your diabetes. As we discussed, it is VERY important that you stop smoking. Quitting smoking decreases your risk of having another heart attack. Here is a summary of your new medications: START metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 25mg once daily START Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 80mg once daily before bed START Aspirin 81mg once daily START Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg once daily for 1 month START Nitrogylcerin 0.4mg beneath the tongue ONLY AS NEEDED for chest pain. If pain continues after 5 minutes you may take a ___ pill. If pain continues after 10 minutes you should take a third pill and call ___. ","Primary Reason for Hospitalization: ___ M with h/o smoking and diabetes presents with NSTEMI . ACTIVE ISSUES: # NSTEMI (s/p BMS to LCX): BMS selected due to concern about compliance given lack of medical care to date. Risk factors in this patient were obesity, smoking, and uncontrolled diabetes. The patient was previously taking no medcations and he was started on the following - plavix 75mg X 1 month minimum. 12 months if tolerated. - ASA 81mg indefinitely - metoprolol succinate 25mg for now, uptitrate as tolerated - atorvastatin 80mg qhs - Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4mg Over 20 minutes were spent counseling the patient and his wife about smoking cessation. It was also stressed how important it will be for him to have regular follow-up with both a PCP and cardiology. An appointment was set up with Dr. ___ at ___ ___ cardiology on ___. A TTE was performed which showed Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction (EF 50-55%). The patient did not have any clinical evidence of heart failure. . # DMII (HbA1c = 11%) Patient reported that he was just trying to control his DM with diet however this clearly has not been sufficient. He did not have a PCP that actively followed with and he did not check his blood sugars. The patient requested to have a PCP close to his home therefore he was given the phone number for the doctor's line to get established with a new PCP. The patient was told he needs to be seen within one week of discharge. He was told that if he cannot get follow-up within that time he should call Dr. ___ at ___ to help coordinate follow-up in the interim. Most likely the patient will require multiple oral medications to control his blood sugar if not insulin. No medications were initiated prior to discharge given that the patient was already being started on 4 new medications which appeared to be somewhat overwhelming. He will also need teaching on how to test his blood sugar at home. The patient was counseled on the signs and symptoms of high and low blood sugar. . # HLD: LDL 129. He was started on atorvastatin 80mg. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Studies pending at the time of discharge: Final Cath Report - Patient's new primary care provider should coordinate diabetes teaching and initiate diabetes therapy.

We used heparin boluses to achieve the therapeutic ACT. We then used a Runthrough wire to cross the lesion with minimal difficulty. We then predilated the lesion with a 2.5 x 20 Emerge balloon. The lesion did not expand and we then used a 2.5 x 12 mm NC Emerge balloon to dilate the lesion again. We then deployed a 2.75 x24 mm Promus Premier DES in the mid to distal LAD and then deployed another 3.0 x16 mm Promus Premier DEs in the mid LAD. We post dilated the stent in the proximal portion with a 3.0 x20 mm NC emerge balloon. The final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis and no dissections. We then diverted our attention to the left circumflex lesion and crossed the lesion with minimal difficulty with a Runthrough wire. We predilated the lesion proximal to the previous stent with a 2.0 x20 NC Emerge balloon. The final angiogram showed 20% residual stenosis and no dissection. Patient tolerated the procedure well and left the lab in stable condition. She was also loaded with Plavix 600 mg on the table at the conclusion of the procedure. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation. 1.

Per patient, she was in her normal state of health until the night prior to admission. She was lying in bed around 730 or 8pm, when she suddenly noted left-sided chest discomfort ""behind the breast"" with involvement of her left shoulder blade. She noted concurrent indigestion as well as sensation of needing to burp. She was able to ""burp up"" some ""phlegm"" without any emesis and felt better. This episode lasted for about 15 minutes. She denies any radiation of the pain, worsening with exertion, or relationship with position. She denies any shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, or abdominal discomfort. She has never had this before and she does remember eating a ham and cheese sandwich about an hour prior to this event. The next morning, she woke up without any issues. She took her morning multivitamin and then about an hour later, developed indigestion with nausea and no emesis. She again had an urge to ""burp up phlegm"" and had an associated bilateral anterior chest discomfort, non-radiating, slightly different from the symptoms she was having the night previously. This time, the pain lasted nearly 2 hours in duration. She took a Tylenol with no relief. She laid down in her bed to try and rest it off, but this did not help. She again denies any associated symptoms and her daughter, who was home with her decided to call an ambulance to take her to ___ for further evaluation. While in the ambulance, without any intervention, her pain resolved, about 5 minutes prior to arriving in the ED. Otherwise she denies any recent illnesses, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND, ___ swelling, diarrhea (apart from her daily loose stools), or arm/jaw pain. She has no DOE or SOB. She has a baseline cough with some production of sputum and no recent changes from this. She Of note, the patient does carry a diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms, most recently imaged (detailed below) at ___ in ___ and ___. These include several left MCA aneurysms ranging from 2-5mm in diameter without any evidence of rupture. She also saw Dr. ___ ___ neurology) in ___ after her initial MRA in ___ and during that visit, he concluded that ""[I]f an aneurysm would rupture, this could be a potentially fatal situation. On the other hand, if the patient's posterior circulation TIAs became a fixed stroke, at this time the area involves seems to be a small area and would not be potentially fatal. Therefore focusing upon the problem that potentially has more serious consequences, I would recommend that the patient be free of any type of anticoagulation. I would not recommend an antiplatelet therapy and in fact statin drugs have an anticoagulation effect, and I would even recommend doing away with statin drugs and using other types of drugs and diet therapy to address the cholesterol."" Of note, shortly after this visit, in ___, she did have repeat MRA, which called into question whether her previously visualized aneurysms were truly aneurysms or whether they were atherosclerotic lesions. Since, then the patient has not received any aspirin or blood thinners, although she does not recall every being told not to take them. She also has not had any neurology follow-up since that visit with Dr. ___. In the ED, initial vitals: 96.6 80 156/82 18 99% RA Exam was notable for: nothing documented ECG per my read notable for sinus rhythm with ventricular rates of 81 bpm; physiologic left axis, inferior TWI and probable LVH with non-specific lateral ST-TW changes; with anterior Q waves, cannot rule out prior anterior infarct; compared with prior on ___, inferior TWI's and lateral ST-TW changes are new Labs were notable for: -CBC showing normal white count, Hgb 9.7 (baseline ___ -Chem10 notable for Bicarb 21, BUN/Cr 38/2.8 (baseline ___ -Trop 0.18 -> 0.26 -CK-MB negative x2 -U/A notable only for 30 protein, few bacteria -Urine culture pending Imaging notable for: CXR notable for: Subtle patchy right base opacity is most likely due to overlap of vascular structures and atelectasis, but pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.

You were hospitalized because you had a small heart attack. The blood vessels around your heart were examined (cardiac catheterization or ""cath""), which showed a blocked artery. You were given medications to prevent new blockages. WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? -It is very important that you continue to take aspirin and clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) every day. These two medications help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. -Take all of your other new medications as prescribed (see medication list). -Follow up with your primary doctor next week and your new cardiologist this month (see appointments below). -We would also like you to follow-up with neurosurgery for repeat pictures of your brain. -Refrain from aerobic exercise or heavy lifting for at least one week. It is safe for you to return to work after that. Talk to your new cardiologist before beginning an exercise routine. -Please quit smoking and reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. We are always available to assist you in your efforts to quit. -___ medical care if you develop chest pain or difficulty breathing. We wish you all the best. Sincerely, Your ___ care team ","___ female with array of risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and remote history of left MCA aneurysm, left ICA aneurysm complicated by TIA, and chronic kidney disease stage IV admitted for NSTEMI. Coronary angiography revealed culprit RCA lesion. #) NSTEMI, type I: while features of her chest pain were atypical, rising cardiac enzymes and new T-wave inversions in anteroseptal precordial leads on background said risk factors were suggestive of true unstable plaque rupture in probable LAD distribution. She was empirically heparinized when cleared by neurosurgery. TTE was obtained, which instead demonstrated hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferoseptal segments, but globally preserved biventricular systolic function. She thus proceeded with coronary angiography, which revealed 100% occluded RCA with well established left to right collateralization, which was not intervened upon, as well as non-obstructive LCx (50% stenosis) and D1 (40% stenosis) disease. She received periprocedural hydration as prophylaxis against contrast induced nephropathy. She was also pre-medicated for idoniated contrast allergy per ___ protocol. Heparin was later discontinued in favor of aspirin and clopidogrel. Metoprolol was converted to carvedilol 12.5 mg BID for better alpha antagonism in the absence of home lisinopril, which was held for renal insufficiency above baseline and impending contrast load. #) Cerebral aneurysm: once deemed an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Surveillance head CT obtained after therapeutic PTT was unremarkable. MRA head revealed a single 3 mm left ICA aneurysm, which was considered at minimal, and thus, acceptable risk of hemorrhage. No intervention was warranted. Neurosurgery cleared patient for heparin and dual-antiplatelet therapy in that regard. ___ on chronic kidney disease, stage IV: presumably secondary to hypertensive nephropathy. Creatinine 2.8 on arrival from baseline creatinine 2.0-2.5. She received gentle hydration in anticipation of catheterization, which was then continued for low-normal LVEDP, albeit minor contrast load. Lisinopril was held at discharge for unchanged creatinine. #) Alcohol use disorder: notably, has history of withdrawal seizures. Last drink reportedly evening prior to admission. Monitored on CIWA without benzodiazepine needs. CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: #) Anemia: near-macrocytosis at baseline 10-range. Presume secondary to chronic kidney disease and alcohol myelotoxicity. #) Hypertension: home lisinopril 5 mg held, as above. Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID added for alpha antagonism. =================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== NEW MEDICATIONS -Aspirin 81 mg daily -Atorvastatin 80 mg daily -Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID -Clopidogrel 75 mg daily CHANGED MEDICATIONS: none.

CATH COMMENTS: 1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant systemt demonstrated three-vessel nonobstructive disease. The LMCA had mild-moderate plaquing. The LAD was diffusely disease to 60% beginning inthe proximal vessel and spanning the origin of a moderately diffusely diseased (up to 40%) first diagonal branch. There were luminal irregularities in the mid-distal LAD. The LCx had an ostial bidurcation 60% stenosis involving a high first obtuse marginal branch. There were luminal irregularities in the third and fourth obtuse marginal branches. The proximal RCA stent was patent, but there was diffuse disese throughout the RCA to 50% proximally with some ulcerations and calcifications. There was a 50% stenosis in the distal AV groove RCA just after RPL2. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures with an LEVDP of 24 mm Hg. There was severe systemic arterial hypertension with an SBP of 180 mm Hg. There was no gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three-vessel non-flow-limiting coronary artery disease with no obvious culprit lesion and essentially unchanged from prior angiography. 2. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. 3. Severe systemic arterial hypertension.

Initially he thought his symptoms were due to reflux, however his most recent episode not relieved by antacids. In the ED pain improved with nitro and morphine. He had no ECG changes, however had increasing troponins with normal CKs. He was started on a heparin gtt. He was started on high dose aspirin, statin, beta blocker, plavix (loaded in the ER), and heparin gtt. The patient was taken for cardiac catheriterization and a small diagonal branch (2.0mm) with a 60% stenosis at the origin. There was no intervention and medical management was initiated. He was started on Imdur and continued on high dose aspirin, plavix (will continue until his cardiology appointment), beta blocker, and statin. In addition, he was given sublingual nitroglycerin for acute anginal pain. In order to ___ medical manage his coronary disease, he will need optimal control of his diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. . # Diabetes Mellitus II: The patient was found to have a hemoglobin A1C of 8.5. He currently takes Metformin and insulin. The patient was advised to hold his Metformin for one day after discharge (since he received contrast for cath). He was also advised to work with his primary care doctor to better control his blood sugar. . # Dyslipidemia: The patient was noted to have a calculated LDL of 84 (without treatment) and a triglycerides of 335 on admission. He was started on pravastatin 20 mg daily and fish oil (for triglyceridemia). Since he had associated myalgias with statin use in the past, he was advised to take Coenzyme Q10 to prevent the myalgias. . # Hypertension: The patient initially was hypertensive to 190/80 when he came to the floor, however, with his medications, he lowered to normal values. The patient complained of a persistent dry cough over months, so his lisinopril 30 mg was switched to Valsartan 50 mg. He was also started on metoprolol 12.5 mg BID on this admission. There were no issues with optimal blood pressure control. Outpatient followup: 1. Medication adherence 2. Optimal dyslipidemia, DM II, and HTN control 3.

Patient says that she generally has chest pain with exertion, pressure-like and ___ in severity. She quickly notices when it comes on and will sit down for half an hour or so to watch TV and it will go away without any other complications. Patient says that she developed significantly worse chest pain starting on ___. She was out shopping for food in the market and while going down one aisle she felt slightly lightheaded. Thinking that she might be hypoglycemic, patient went to the candy aisle and got some gum drops. She then felt a little bit better and was able to get through the checkout and make her way home. Upon walking up seven stairs into her house, patient started to feel significant chest pressure. She went to her living room to sit down, noting that the pain quickly became ___ in severity. She asked her daughter to call the ambulance. When patient was putting on her shoes, the pain became ""crushing"" and ___ in severity. There was some radiation of the discomfort into her right arm (of note, patient says that her right ring finger had been numb the day prior). Patient was experiencing shortness of breath and diaphoresis at the time. No palpitations or persistent lightheadedness/dizziness. EMS gave patient a sublingual nitro, though she thinks that it was supplemental oxygen that made her feel much more comfortable (oxygen saturation was reportedly 70% and patient was placed on BiPAP). She was then brought to ___ for urgent evaluation/management. On arrival, patient was chest pain free and hemodynamically stable, quickly taken off of bipap. She was thought to be in a HF exacerbation and so was administered furosemide ___ intravenous daily). Troponin I peaked at 0.54 --> 10.6 --> 6. No ST changes noted on EKG. Patient was initiated on a heparin drip. She was evaluated by cardiology, decision was made to transfer to ___ given that she receives all of her cardiology care here. Hospitalization was otherwise notable for Cr elevated at 2.9 (previous baseline seems to be ___, most recently 2.3 ___ as well as hypertension with systolics 160-170s (improved to 120s at time of transfer). It appears that she may have been started on CAP coverage (ceftriaxone/azithromycin) given her leukocytosis and hypoxia, though chest x-ray did not demonstrate any focal infiltrate and so antibiotics were discontinued. Labs at ___ were notable as follows: White blood cell count 11.0, hemoglobin 9.3, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 203 Sodium 136, potassium 4.7, creatinine 2.95 Troponin I 0.543, 10.6, 6 ProBNP 3889 Hemoglobin A1c 4.9% Total cholesterol 127, HDL 41, LDL calculated 64, triglycerides 112 Repeat CBC showed white blood cell count 7.4 and hemoglobin 8.6 Of note, patient was last seen in cardiology clinic ___. At that point show was feeling short of breath upon exertion in addition to having some chest discomfort. Stress testing ___ had shown moderate reversible perfusion defect in the anterior and apical walls and also showed mild global hypokinesis with an EF of 43%. It was not felt that she had many options available to her for revascularization and so maximal GDMT was pursued. CKD of course has limited repeat attempts at coronary angiography. Carvedilol was increased to 12.5mg BID given mild hypertension and ranolazine was increased to 1000mg BID. Otherwise, she continued on isosorbide mononitrate 30mg qd in addition to losartan 25mg qd. From a heart failure standpoint, most recent TTE had shown LVEF >55% and patient appeared euvolemic. On the floor, patient recounts the history as above. She says that once she was given oxygen her chest pain improved to ___ in severity. After several hours at ___, patient says that her pain lessened to almost nothing, though she describes herself as having a high pain tolerance. At present, she says that the pain is still there to some extent (___), though her main complaint is some indigestion after having a large meal for dinner. Additionally, patient says that she thinks she may have hurt her ribs when she fell last week. Patient says that she tripped in her kitchen and fell on her left side, her left leg was swollen for several days, though is now improving. 10 point review of systems is otherwise negative. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> 1.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? -========= - You were admitted because you had a heart attack. You initially received some nitroglycerin and oxygen, which improved your chest pain. We contacted your cardiologist, Dr. ___ felt medical management of your heart attack with medications was most appropriate at this time. -We started you a on a medication called Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg once daily. This is one of the medications used to help treat your heart attack. -We increased your blood pressure medication (Imdur) from 30mg once daily to 90mg once daily, as well as amlodipine 2.5mg once daily to 5mg once daily to lower your blood pressure. This is so your heart does not have to work as hard to pump blood through the body. - You were also admitted to the hospital because you had too much fluid in your body. This was felt to be due to a condition called heart failure, where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up in your body. You were given a diuretic medication to help get the fluid out. You improved considerably and were ready to leave the hospital. WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? --== -Continue to take all of your medications as directed, including the new increased dose of the Imdur 90mg once daily, and the new medication, Plavix 75mg once daily. -Please follow up with your outpatient primary care doctor and cardiologist. -Your weight at discharge is 169.71 lbs (76.98 kg).

Neurology was consulted in the ED for LLE weakness noted on ED resident evaluation. . When I initially attempted to discuss her neurologic complaint, she interrupted my questioning frequently with tangential comments about other symptoms. She said ""ooh, ___ when attempting to sit up while we were talking. She complains of pain in her Left > right hip since yesterday morning. Hypothesized that her mattress is too hard. Seems slightly out of breath, tired. . Later, she agrees that her reason for ED presentation was ""I was draggin my [left] leg."" Also says her arms were moving ""like I'm a puppet."" But arms never moved on their own (no shaking or incoordination), and were never weak, she just felt like she couldn't control them as well as usual. On reconsideration, says it was not her left leg alone, it is both her legs, but the left is worse. Says today is the first time she has ever experienced such symptoms. Says last year she couldn't pick up the front of her feet (both feet), which is different from her gait difficulties last ___. She was able to navigate her stairs and walk without falling at home, but she is certain that her gait is off balance relative to usual. She spoke with neighbor, ___, and told him ""I think I'm having a stroke."" The neighbor said he thought she's alright. Speech comprehension/production was subjectively normal at that time. She decided she needed evaluation for stroke and came to the ED. Yesterday, she thinks she felt fine initially, but says ""I'm gettin my days mixed up."" She remembers taking her ___ year-old neighbor girl to play in a pool with her ___ year-old ___ who has ""the same personality"" (long tangent). She remembers telling them at the pool that she felt funny due to recent dizzy spells and migraine headaches. Dizzy spells for a month off and on, feeling ""woozy"" and ""a little dizzy."" She never passes out or feels like she will pass out, but just feels a ""little wobbly"" on her feet. She has felt like this intermittently for about a month, but never before that she can remember. Symptoms are worst when she stands from a seated position. Never triggered by moving head. Endorses a spinning sensation sometimes. Back of neck hurts sometimes, but not now. No recent trauma. No medicines for this symptom; takes aspirin for migraine. Yesterday a neighbor gave her two ibuprofen, which helped relieve her headache. Yesterday, she was supposed to see her PCP, but says she had to cancel because she didn't get her SS check in time to pay for the appointment. She had wanted to see her PCP ___. her increased headaches and dizzy sensation. Her headaches are ""pounding,"" mostly R-sides, migrates slowly to the occiput. Sometimes lasts two days. Endorses photophobia, says sunlight causes awful headache. Napping provides the most relief. Used to take a different PRN medication that helped relieve the headaches (better than aspirin/NSAIDs), but Rx ran out (Rx from Dr. ___ at ___. Cannot remember name ___. ___ last presented to our hospital in ___ with what she calls a ""stroke."" Our records indicate that she presented with ?TIA (veering to the right when walking and slurred speech), with suspicion for small-vessel disease. Her MRI was negative for recent infarction (there was e/o Left-cerebellar lacune on CT and MRI, as well as several ""dots and spots"" white matter MVID, especially a focus in the right parietal white matter). Exam findings at that time were possible ataxia/slowing of R-sided movements, with a normal examination the following morning. She also had an episode a couple years before that (TIA vs. migraine) with a few minutes of word-finding difficulty. She continues smoking, says she tries to quit. Still 1 ppd. Last year, we re-started her aspirin at 325mg daily (she had stopped taking it). Her LDL at that time was 120, so she was started on Tricor -- she stopped taking this medication since then and is not taking any lipid-lowering medications. She says ""I don't know why I stopped taking it"" and confirms that she is allergic to statins. She was followed in clinic by Dr. ___, with no recurrence of her symptoms or change in exam findings. Dr. ___ a ___, which did not reveal any clot or vegetations or other abnormalities of concern.

Left intracranial carotid artery siphon stenosis CHRONIC ISSUES 1. Hypertension 2. Hyperlipidemia 3. Insulin-dependent type II diabetes 4. Coronary artery disease 5. History of TIA <DISCHARGE CONDITION> Mental Status: Confused - sometimes. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to the hospital with left leg weakness. You were found to have a stroke on the right side of your brain. You underwent several tests including an MRI, an angiogram, an echocardiogram and a CT scan to obtain the diagnosis. We believe your stroke was caused by narrowing of the carotid artery (a blood vessel supplying the brain), and also possibly by small blood clots (emboli) collecting in the brain. . You have several risk factors that put you at risk for stroke: smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. We adjusted your medications in the hospital to treat the high blood pressure and high cholesterol. We also started you on a drug called Plavix (Clopidogrel) to prevent future strokes. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you take your meds EVERY DAY at home to prevent future strokes. You also made the excellent decision to quit smoking while in the hospital! We wish you the very best with that. . Please attend the follow up appointments with your PCP ___ ___ and with Neurology (___) listed below. . We made the following changes to your medications: 1. STARTED clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg by mouth daily 2. STARTED pravastatin 40mg by mouth daily 3. STARTED nicotine patch 14mg: apply one patch daily 3. DECREASED aspirin to 81mg by mouth daily 4. DECREASED lisinopril from 40mg daily to 10mg daily 5. STOPPED amlodipime 5mg daily 6. DECREASED isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur) to 30mg by mouth daily ","Ms. ___ is a ___ right-handed woman with a history of hypertension, hyprelipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease/MI s/p stent (___), and TIA (___) who was transferred to the ___ ED due to difficulty walking and dizziness. . # STROKE: In the ED, a Neurology consult was called, which did not reveal any gait abnormality or lower extremity weakness, but did show some left hand clumsiness. CT head showed several hypodensities in the right parietal lobe and a stable old lacunar infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The patient was admitted to the Neurology service for further evaluation. An MRI of the head showed multiple small acute infarcts in the right occipital lobe and a small subcortical infarct in the right centrum semiovale. An echocardiogram was performed but did not identify an intraatrial septal defect or source of thromboembolism. A CTA of the head and neck was performed to assess the cerebral vasculature and revealed a fetal PCA. Angiography was performed and revealed tight stenosis of her right carotid siphon. Thus it was hypothesized that the etiology of her stroke was watershed infarct of right fetal PCA, possibly also with embolic component as well. Her right carotid stenosis was evaluated and discussed by the ___ Radiology and Neurology teams, and the decision was made to medically manage the stenoses with anti-platelet therapy (clopidogrel). Her home ASA was decreased from 325mg daily to 81mg daily to reduce risk of bleeding. Her blood pressure medications were down-titrated, initially to allow autoregulation after her stroke and then, after discovery of the watershed infarct, to allow her to run slightly high as to better perfuse this territory. She was re-started on oral pravastatin 40 mg daily for management of her cholesterol (LDL 123), as she had not been taking her home dose of a statin. . # AGITATION: Upon transfer to the Neurology service, Ms. ___ was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. However, she became agitated, paranoid, disoriented to place, and hostile toward the staff on the night of hospital day 2, requiring urgent psychiatric consultation, sedation with haloperidol, and use of soft restraints. Over the following 2 days, she was no longer paranoid and her agitation decreased, but she maintained a persistent delusion that she was in her own home. On hospital day 4, she re-gained orientation to place and was amnestic to her prior agitation and delusional behavior. She was ruled out for all toxic-metabolic sources of delirium during hospitalization, and had no h/o EtOH abuse making withdrawal unlikely. It was felt that her agitated delirium was likely secondary to the occipito-parietal location of her stroke, as well as a possible superimposed component of nicotine withdrawal given her >1 PPD history. . # HIP PAIN: While on the Neurology service, Ms. ___ also complained of left hip pain. A hip X-ray revealed only mild osteoarthritis but no fracture or dislocation. The pain resolved on hospital day 2. . # SMOKING CESSATION: Ms. ___ was counselled extensively regarding the need for her to quit smoking. She maintained on a nicotine patch throughout her hospital stay. On discharge, she seemed committed to quitting smoking with the support of her family. . # QUESTION OF LARYNGEAL MASS AND MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY ON CT: CTA head incidentally found mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a question of vocal chord adduction + secretions vs. laryngeal mass. Ms. ___ denied any throat discomfort or change in her voice. She was counselled to follow-up with her PCP regarding further evaluation of these findings. ",4651,843,13

You were admitted to the hospital with a heart attack. We treated you with a cardiac catheterization which showed blockage in the arteries supplying your heart. We treated you with two stents with improvement in blood flow. After your catheterization, you were found to have some low blood pressure. This was likely related to your heart attack. We treated you with some medicine to improve your blood pressure and you improved. It is very important that you take all of your medications after discharge, particularly your aspirin and clopidogrel. You should follow up with your primary care physician and ___ cardiologist after discharge. We wish you the very best! - Your ___ Medicine Team ","___ with no significant past medical history presenting with inferior STEMI s/p PCI complicated by RCA dissection, now s/p ___ 2 to RCA. # ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: The patient presented with chest pain found to have inferior STEMI with 100% proximal RCA occlusion. She was treated with PCI and DES x1 to proximal RCA. PCI was complicated by RCA dissection so patient was treated with additional DES to mid-RCA. Pt had some hypotension post-procedure thought to be secondary to vagal response due to inferior STEMI, treated with brief course of levophed which was successfully weaned. The patient was started on ASA, ticagrelor, atorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril. TTE showed EF 45% with hypokinesis of inferior free wall. The patient should have follow-up electrolytes and BP check as outpatient for titration of BP medications. # TYPE 2 DIABETES: Patient noted to have A1c 6.6% incidentally as part of post-STEMI work-up, which meets criteria for diagnosis of diabetes. The patient should f/u with PCP for further management and consideration of medical therapy or lifestyle modification if needed. # BACK PAIN: Chronic, secondary to MVA, described as sharp pain radiating down leg. The patient's diclofenac was held on discharge due to concern for cardiac risk with NSAIDs. The patient should f/u with PCP after discharge for further management of pain. Transitional Issues - Lisinopril started on discharge. Will need to follow up electrolytes and bp as an outpatient and titrate accordingly - f/u with cardiology after discharge - f/u with PCP after discharge - f/u blood sugar management, consider monitoring blood sugar and possible starting oral agent - pt previously on diclofenac for back pain, held upon discharge due new cardiac diagnosis. Consider alternative regimen for pain control after discharge. ",2247,406,13

Start raniti___ as needed for your heartburn ","___ yo M with hx of HIV, DMII, HLD presented from OSH with sx of chest pain found to have lateral STEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization with DES placed in RCA. . ACTIVE ISSUES: # STEMI - Pt presented with chest pain found to have ST elevations in II, III, avF, V3-V6 with reciprocal depression in I, aVL, V1 and V2. Cardiac enzymes intially showed CK-MB 71 and troponin 5.02. Cardiac catheterization showed large RCA thrombus which was treated with a DES to mid-distal RCA. While in the cath lab, he developed self-limited VT lasting 60 seconds. Post cath, ST inferiolateral segments remain elevated despite being pain free. Loaded with plavix, started integrilin, no antiarrythmics started. Angioseal was placed in right groin at 10AM. The patient was continued on integrillin for 18 hrs after cath, plavix, and ASA. He was started on metoprolol, captopril and atorvastatin. Nitro was held given that he had a large inferior MI. Post cath echo showed LVEF of 40-45 and inferior/inferolateral akinesis and inferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis. Patient remained chest pain free through the remainder of admission. He was discharged on ASA, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin with plans to follow up with Dr. ___. . #thrombocytopenia - On the evening of cardiac catheterization, platelet count was 12, repeat 13 (initially 83 on presentation). A peripheral smear verified this finding and there was no evidence of schistocytes present. The drop in platelet count was attributed to integrillin side effect. No platelet transfusion was given as transfused platelets will not have been exposed to aspirin and plavix and did not want to risk thrombosing new stent. There was no evidence of active bleed. After the discontinuation of integrillin platelets trended up. At time of discharge platelet count was 75. . CHRONIC ISSUES: # DM type 2: stable. non insulin dependent, reports home sugars 130-180s Initially held home oral medications and was managed with SSI. On day 2, pt was restarted on home oral medications (metformin and glipizide). A1C was 9.3 on this admission. Will need follow up for tighter glucose control with his primary care physician. . # HIV: on ARV since ___. Unknown last CD4 count or viral load Home medications were verified with his pharmacy and continued . # GERD: stable given ranitidine 150 mg po BID during admission . # Hyperlipidemia: lipid panel completed (see results section). Pt started on atorvastatin 80 which was decreased from 80 to 40 given interaction risk of rhabdomyolysis. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # diabetes: Given elevated A1c on admission, patient needs tigher glucose control. He will need to follow up with his PCP for possible medication adjustments. ",2546,681,13

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. We saw on MRI that ___ had a small stroke (not a TIA) that caused your weakness. This was most likely caused by small vessel disease, which is from high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol. We stopped your aspirin, started Plavix, which is similar to aspirin, and increased your atorvastatin to decrease your risk of stroke in the future. ___ will have physical therapy at home per physical therapy recommendations. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed ___ for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: high blood pressure diabetes atherosclerosis of your blood vessels high cholesterol We are changing your medications as follows: stop aspirin start Plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily increase atorvastatin to 80 mg nightly Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to ___ - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team ","___ woman with a history of HTN and DM presented with acute onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech that lasted for 2 hours before resolving spontaneously prior to presentation to the hospital. She was admitted to the stroke service. CT head showed hypodensity in the right basal ganglia. MRI brain w/o contrast confirmed small acute infarct in the right putamen and as well as the body of the right caudate nucleus. Her stroke was most likely secondary to small vessel disease given the location and her risk factors. We did consider this a failure of ASA.

He initially presented to ___ on ___ after presenting to ___ with chest discomfort without biomarker evidence of MI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have 90% right PDA and 30% proximal LAD lesions. He underwent successful PTCA and stenting of the PDA lesion with a 3 x 13 mm Cypher DES. He was subsequently seen again at ___ in early ___ for complaints of chest discomfort and underwent a nuclear stress test on ___ where he was only able to exercise 1.5 minutes of a modified ___ protocol. There was no evidence of a MI, and he was discharged. He was seen in cardiology follow up with Dr. ___ on ___ where he underwent an echocardiogram which once again revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of 50%and no valvular disease. Because he reported his chest discomfort to be similar to his pain prior to the PDA stent he was referred for relook coronary angiography to rule out in-stent restenosis; angiography demonstrated patent arteries. Since that time, patient has been doing well, only requiring nitroglycerin for chest pain once every three months on average. On the evening of ___, he developed substernal chest pain which occurred at rest and radiated down the left arm causing numbness and tingling. It lasted 30 minutes, was ___ in severity, accompanied by palpitations. After 1 SL TNG, the pain resolved, but then returned. He took another SL TNG without relief and called EMS. He presented to ___ on evening of ___ with what was felt to be recurrent unstable angina. In the ___ ED, he received nitroglycerin, nitro-paste, and aspirin. EKG showed 100% paced rhythm at 61 bpm. He became pain free. He denied nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, fevers, chills or cough.

You were transferred to ___ because you had chest pain and given your history there was concern for a blockage in one of the arteries that feed your heart. We performed a cardiac catheterization that did not show any obvious areas of blockages and no intervention was undertaken at that time. We felt it was safe for you to go home. You will follow up with your cardiologist and PCP as an outpatient. We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED plavix STARTED imdur 30mg daily to prevent chest pain STARTED colace to prevent constipation STARTED senna to prevent constipation. (It is important you take colace and senna because you are taking percoset which can cause significant constipation. You can also use miralax as needed for constipation as you have done previously.) CHANGED warfarin to 5mg daily. Take 5mg daily until the ___ clinic makes adjustments. You need to go to the ___ clinic where you have beeen going to have your INR drawn on ___. They will give you further instructions on future follow up and medication dosing. You need to discuss your blood sugar control with your PCP. In the hospital your blood sugar was too high, and this can mean you have diabetes. It is very important that if you have heart disease your blood sugar remains under good control. **IMPORTANT** If you continue to have groin pain not improving by this weekend please call your cardiologist Dr. ___ at ___ ","___ y/o man with H/O dilated cardiomyopathy with preserved overall LVEF, s/p PPM ___, chronic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, CAD s/p DES to right PDA ___ with no flow-limiting disease on repeat coronary angiography ___, now transferred from ___ with marker negative unstable angina. # Chest pain - Patient with H/O DES to right PDA in ___, with angina in ___ which prompted cardiac catheterization which showed no flow-limiting lesions. Recently, he developed chest pain while at rest which prompted admission to the OSH. He has not had chest pain for the last several months and only uses his nitroglycerin ___ times per year. No history of crescendo angina as patient was not having chest pain with exertion. Cardiac biomarkers negative for necrosis. Patient reportedly (per outside cardiologist) had a nuclear stress test showing inferior wall ischemia. Furthermore, given significant history of CAD, and numerous risk factors (diabetes mellitus, HTN, hyperlipidemia - and use of ASA in past week), patient was transferred to ___ for cardiac catheterization. EKG did also show new T wave inversions in anterolateral leads. Radial arterial access was attempted, however vasospasm there resulted in a femoral approach. Catheterization was technically very challenging as patient had tortuous vessels and large body habitus. Procedure showed no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions on the left system, however, right coronary artery could not be engaged selectively, and only nonselective imaging was performed of the RCA. No obvious severe stenoses were appreciated. He remained completely chest-pain free throughout the entire duration of this hospitalization. On discharge, Plavix was stopped given apparently patent coronary arteries and ongoing systemic anticoagulation. It was felt that his chest pain was either related to his known GERD or some transient musculoskeletal pain vs. possibility of small clot which propagated distally or lysed spontaneously. Imdur was added to his home CAD regimen to control symptoms of chest pain should they be CAD related, see below. # CAD: Patient with H/O CAD s/p PCI of right PDA in ___, with patent coronaries on angiography ___. He was sent home on medical regimen of aspirin, metoprolol, fenofibrate, Crestor, and newly started Imdur. # ___ on CKD - Cr up to 1.9 on admission. His baseline was 1.5, likely due to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His creatinine slowly trended down to 1.6 on discharge (arguing against contrast nephropathy). Unclear etiology ___ as patient denied any decrease in PO intake. # Cardiomyopathy: Reported history of dilated cardiomyopathy, unable to obtain TTE records. PMIBI ___ reportedly showed inferior wall hypokinesis. Patient did not have evidence of significant volume overload on exam, with LVEDP 17 mm Hg (consistent with mild diastolic dysfunction). Home dose Lasix was continued. # Atrial fibrillation - Patient with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. On admission to ___ was 3.3. Coumadin had been held the day of transfer and patient was given PO vitamin K prior to transfer as well. The day after admission, INR remained at 3.2 and he was given another small dose of PO vitamin K. Following day, ___ INR was 1.8 and patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, see chest pain above. Warfarin was restarted evening of ___ at 5 mg daily, and patient was instructed to follow up with his ___ clinic regarding INR levels and warfarin dosing. Home digoxin, diltiazem, and metoprolol were continued for rate control. Outpatient cardiologist was contacted regarding his rate control regimen as patient was paced the majority of the time, suggesting possibly excessive rate control. Last pacer interrogation showed pacing of >70%. It appeared that he has been very difficult to rate control in the past so his home regimen was not adjusted at this time. # Dyslipidemia - LDL 35. Triglycerides elevated. Home Crestor and fenofibrate were continued. # Diabetes mellitus - Patient not on medications at home but recent A1c 6.5. FSG monitored with SSI administered accordingly. He was instructed to follow with his PCP regarding blood glucose control. # GERD - omeprazole was continued. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Patient was to follow with his PCP regarding blood glucose control.

The patient explains he was in his usual state of health until about one month ago. At that time, he went shopping at a familiar mall. While perusing in the aisles, he realized he did not know how to exit the building. Even with the help of directions, he had trouble finding his way. The episode lasted about 15 minutes before spontaneously resolving. Once outside he was able to drive himself home without difficulty. About two weeks later, he was walking along the beach when he experienced the sudden weakening of the knees bilaterally. The episode was transient (seconds) and he did not actually fall. The episode was not associated with any other symptoms. In the course of the month prior to evaluation, the patient has also experienced 10 to 15-minute episodes of sensory changes in the left lower extremity. He describes the sudden onset of ""numbness"" distal to the left knee; he indicates the sensation encompasses the entire lower limb and foot. He further elaborates that the leg transiently feels ""like dead wood,"" as ""if it does not belong to me."" He cannot identify any reliable triggers; he recalls standing to do housework during the first event but also reports experiencing the sensation while supine in bed. He denies associated symptoms including right lower extremity and upper extremity weakness, sensory changes, and facial symptoms. The symptom spontaneously resolved. Episodes now occur weekly. Concerned, he sought the attention of his primary care doctor who ordered an MRI. The MRI was reported to show changes concerning for acute watershed infracts in the right premotor region, lentiform nucleus, and posterior parietal subcortical white matter in addition to the absence of flow in the right cavernous internal carotid artery and poor flow in the right middle cerebral and distal left vertebral arteries. At the suggestion of his PCP, the patient presented to the ___ for further evaluation and care. At the time of our initial evaluation, the patient denied active symptoms. In the course of the interview, however, he reported the onset of the left lower extremity symptoms. When asked to lie down, he reported the resolution of the syndrome.

MRI/A head/neck ___ ___: FINDINGS: There is an approximately 1 cm area of restricted diffusion in the right premotor area of the cerebral hemisphere near its vertex, with two additional punctate areas of restricted diffusion, one within the right lentiform nucleus and the second in the right posterior parietal subcortical white matter. These findings are of concern for areas of acute brain ischemia. Relatively minor areas of T2 hyperintensity are seen largely in the periartrial white matter on the right side, consistent with chronic small vessel infarction. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures, nor susceptibility abnormality of the brain. There is an absence of flow void signal within the right cavernous internal carotid artery. MR angiography discloses essentially complete absence of flow in the intracranial right internal carotid artery, in keeping with the prior duplex ultrasound results. There is very poor flow within the right middle cerebral artery. There is also likely a moderate stenosis of the precavernous portion of the left internal carotid artery. There is minimal flow within the distal left vertebral artery, in keeping with the prior duplex ultrasound results. The right vertebral artery is patent and non-stenotic.

Neurological exam remarkable for: Right pupil fixed and ureactive (old retinal hemorrhage), Face symmetric, no dysarthria, no pronator drift, decreased pinprick sensation in a stocking distribution. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to the hospital for symptoms of left leg weakness and numbness. You were found to have acute stroke in right side of your brain. This was felt to be due to either small emboli from your occluded right neck artery (old) or due to blood pressure that may have been too low. In addition, we checked the flow in your left artery, which appeared to be adequate. Your blood pressures should be < 150/80 mmHg rather than typical 130/80 mmHg goal. The following changes were made to your medications: - Started on Plavix 75mg daily - Stopped Norvasc - Lisinopril was decreased to 5mg daily Should you experience any new weakness, numbness, vision changes, difficulties with speech, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptom concerning to you, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room. ","___ year-old man with history including DM, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, PAD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, and known right internal carotid artery occlusion presented to his PCP with ___ history of left lower extremity paresthesias, underwent MRI/A and was found to have evidence of acute watershed infarcts in: - right premotor region - right lentiform nucleus - right posterior parietal subcortical white matter with absence of flow in the right cavernous internal carotid artery and poor flow in the right middle cerebral and distal left vertebral arteries. His exam on admission was notable for a chronically dilated non-reactive right pupil secondary to retinal hemorrhage and decreased pinprick sensation in a stocking distribution. He was asymptomatic during evaluation with exception of one episode of recurrence of his left lower extremity symptoms with standing and resolution with recumbency. Given above findings and history, concerning etiologies included stump emboli from R ICA as well as hypoperfusion of right side due to worsening L ICA disease, as noted by recrudescence of symptoms with standing. Patient was admitted to stroke service for further evaluation. His antihypertensive regimen was adjusted as follows: Norvasc was discontinued, Lisinopril was decreased. BP goal was deemed to be < 150/80 mmHg rather than typical 130/80 mmHg goal. He underwent a carotid duplex study confirming ___ stenosis and showing that L ICA was < 40% stenosed. Given recurrent emboli he was started on Plavix 75mg. Due to prior history of R opth. vein occlusion and secondary neovascularization s/p laser ablation, the risks and benefits of this treatment were discussed with patient and his opthalmologist, Dr. ___. It was agreed that the risk of stroke and their disability outweighted the risks of possible intraoccular hemorrhage on the right. Patient's modifiable risk factor were LDL of 114 and A1C of 9.4%. This was discussed with the patient and PCP. No changes to the multiple lipid lowering agents were made, and an outpatient evaluation by a Lipid specialist was discussed. ___ adjustments were also discussed and will be follow up by PCP. A neurology follow up was arranged, with Dr. ___. ",3708,493,12

Normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Recommendations: 1. Routine post-TR Band care. 2. Angiograms reviewed with Dr. ___ and Dr. ___. High clot burden increases risk of systemic embolization (including disabling stroke) during PCI and portends poor acute outcome of PCI. He may well have mid ___ in-stent restenosis exacerbated by ticagrelor non-compliance resulting in a long tail of thrombus in the stented proximal ___. As infarct likely already completed, would favor heparin infusion without bolus beginning 3 hours after arterial hemostasis with bridge to warfarin with therapeutic INR, ASA 81 mg daily, and change from ticagrelor to prasugrel 10 mg daily to improve likelihood of compliance with triple therapy. Patient reports H/O clots on clopidogrel. He had been on ticagrelor, a BID drug, with reported intermittently missed doses. If patient remains without symptomatic or objective evidence of residual post-infarct angina, would favor management with medical therapy alone without PCI. If patient has objective evidence of ischemia despite optimal ___ medical therapy and triple therapy (DAPT+warfarin), can bring back in a few weeks for repeat angiography to see if the thrombus in the ___ has resolved and if the ___ is more favorable for PCI. 3.

Desats to 84% on room air with ambulation. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath. It was thought to be due to your heart. You had a catheterization that showed an artery that needed a stent. You had another catheterization in which the stent was placed, and then you were monitored in the intensive care unit while you had a balloon pump helping your blood pressure stay high. You continued to have low oxygen saturations while walking, dropping to 84% and will need to go home with oxygen. You did well post cath. You had a few arrhythmias, so the electrophysiologists saw you and helped us adjust your medicines. The following changes were made in your medications: your captopril was stopped and changed to a lower dose of a similar medication called lisinopril. Your metoprolol dose was increased to 100 mg daily. Your diuretic was doubled to 60 mg twice daily. Your quinidine was increased from three to four times daily (~ every 6 hours). You were also started on two new medications: clopidogrel 75 mg daily and digoxin 0.125 mg daily. You have been given prescriptions for these changes. You also developed knee pain which improved after a few doses of indomethacin. This may have been a gout attack, however, the indomethacin was stopped because it may interfere with aspirin. If your knee pain or other gout symptoms return, you should take a short course of a steroid medication called prednisone instead of indomethacin. You have been given a prescription for this should you need it. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight > 3 lbs. Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet. Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, swelling in your feet, or other concerning symptoms. ","___ y/o man with H/O CAD, congestive systolic heart failure, and lung cancer with worsening dyspnea on exertion. History of numerous VT episodes on recent ICD interrogation. # CAD - Known severe coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheretizations this admission showed PCW 22 and LVEDP 26 mm Hg with preserved cardiac index. He had severe LMCA and three vessel disease with patent proximal left subclavian artery stent and patent LIMA-___. Abdominal aortography showed extensive aortic and iliac disease, precluding using of the Impella Assist Device. In consultation with Dr. ___ decision was made to proceed with high risk PCI of the protected LMCA with IABP support. This procedure was delayed for several hours due to arrhythmias (see below), but on ___, a Xience DES was placed in the LMCA into the circumflex artery with right femoral arteriotomy closure using the Mynx device and IABP secured in place in the left femoral artery. The patient was stable after the balloon pump was removed. He was continued on maximal medical management with aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin. # Pump - Has severe chronic systolic and diastolic left ventricular heart failure with recent acute exacerabtion with recent EF of 25% and akinesis to dyskinesis of thinned inferior and infero-lateral walls with slightly dilated LV wall. Repeat echocardiogram here showed moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation, prompting the decision to revascularize the native circumflex in hopes of reducing papillary muscle ischemic dysfunction. His filling pressures were elevated at catheterization. Lasix and spironolactone were continued, and captopril was decreased then changed to low dose lisinopril due to hypotension. # Rhythm - Has a pacer and ICD. Patient did have VT upon interrogation of ICD prior to admission; unclear etiology for this, but likely secondary to ischemia. He had recurrent SVT during this admission with HRs into 160s, mostly asymptomatic with relatively low BPs which are now close to baseline. He was on an amiodarone drip for three days, but then switched back to quinidine, increased to QID instead of his prior dosing at TID. He triggered for atrial fibrillation with VR to 160 the night prior to discharge, however, he had not received his quinidine or metoprolol that evening. He was asymptomatic and his arrhythmia resolved after receiving these medications. He was evaluated by EP who felt that no further changes to his pacer/ICD settings were needed at this time. They may consider ablation in the future if recurrent VT is originating from a scar. He is not anticoagulated at this time. This can be considered in the future if atrial fibrillation returns. His dose of metoprolol was increased on this admission. # Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was likely multifactorial including past lobectomy, worsening heart failure, and asthma. He received ipratropium, fluticasone, salmeterol prn. The patient's dyspnea at rest resolved, however, he desaturated to 84% on room air with amublation the day prior to discharge and again on the of discharge, despite receiving extra Lasix. He was discharged to home with oxygen and pulmonary rehab. He has not previously had home oxygen. # Diabetes mellitus - The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control. # Knee pain - A few days prior to discharge, the patient developed a painful right knee. The patient was afebrile and the knee was not warm. It was felt that his knee pain was most consistent with a gout flare. He was given indomethacin for 24 hours with resolution of his knee pain. This medication was discontinued due to its potential to interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. He was discharged with a prescription for a prednisone burst-taper in the event that his symptoms recur. # Mild Acute Renal Function - The patient had a creatinine elevated to 1.4 on admission, likely due to hypovolemia and poor foward flow from CHF. With pre-hydration prior to catheterization and judicious diuresis, his creatinine had returned to a baseline of 1.2 on the day of discharge. ",3820,937,12

You were transferred to ___ with weakness, low blood pressure, and EKG changes. Given your history of coronary artery disease, this was concerning for a heart attack. Indeed, your bloodwork showed damage to you heart. We treated you with medications to optimize the management of your heart disease. However, you should followup with your cardiologist as you may need a repeat catheterization or stress test in the future. . You also presented to the hospital with new damage to your kidneys. A renal ultrasound did not show any obvious blockage or other damage. Your kidneys may have suffered damage when your blood pressure was low. This will take time to heal. . Finally, we discovered that your dose of thyroid medication, your dose of digoxin, and your dose of amiodarone needed to be adjusted. . We made several changes to your medication regimen: DECREASED amiodarone to 200mg daily (not twice daily) DECREASED levothyroxine to 12.5 mcg daily DECREASED digoxin to 0.125mg every M,W, and F HOLD Lisinopril until you see your doctor HOLD ___ until you see your doctor CHANGED omeprazole to pantoprazole (to minimize plavix interaction) CHANGED simvastatin to atorvastatin (to minimize amiodarone interaction) INCREASED Metoprolol to 50mg daily STARTED Metoclopramide . Please keep all of your followup appointments. Please take all of your medications as prescribed. If you experience any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or other symptoms which concern you, please call your doctor or come to the ER. ","___ year old female with past medical history of CAD status-post CABG, mesenteric ischemia, duodenal ulcer, and ovarian cancer who presents with reported hypotension, nausea, vomiting, sharp abdominal pain and found to have new T wave inversions and elevated troponin, leukocytosis, renal insufficiency, and hyponatremia. # NSTEMI Troponin 0.64 on admission and trending down, CK flat, LDH (elevated at baseline) trending down. ECG showed new T-wave inversions. She was transferred on heparin and this was continued to complete 48 hours. She was angina-free on arrival here and throughout stay even with walking. She likely had MI prior even to admission to ___. Given that she was stable, angina-free, optimally medically managed and with renal insufficiency, we elected not to do catheterization. It may be worthwhile to pursue stress MIBI or cath in the future to determine if there are areas of myocardium that could be revascularized. # Leukocytosis: Likely reactive leukocytosis in setting of ischemia and no localizing symptoms and trended down. Cultures negative, no pneumonia on CXR and CDiff negative. It seems she also received a dose of salumedrol at ___ after a rash from Zosyn and this may have contributed though her WBC was 31 prior to this. Give baseline elevated LDH (could be from mesenteric ischemia but might expect elevated lactate) and high WBC count, would check WBC again as this could be MDS. # Acute kidney insufficiency: Unknown baseline. Did not improve significantly with hydration. Could be ATN from hypotension. Renal ultrasound negative for stent occlusion. Improving on discharge but will hold ACE. Would recommend restart once creatinine at baseline. # HTN: Held home lasix and ACE. Increased metoprolol to 100mg daily. # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia and resolved with hydration. # Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea: Chronic for her though worsened. Mesenteric ischemia vs dysmotility as s/p gastrectomy. Abdominal exam benign and pancreatic enzymes not elevated. Lactate not elevated. Much improved with metoclopramide and post-gastrectomy diet. # Suppressed TSH: Decreased levothyroxine to 12.5mcg. Recommend rechecking TFTs. # h/o atrial fibrillation. Patient in sinus rhythm throughout stay. Had been on amiodarone twice daily but decreased this to once daily. Digoxin level elevated on admission so this was held for several days and then restarted at 125mcg three times weekly. Continued metoprolol. # History of duodenal ulcer. GUIAIC negative. Continued BID PPI but switched to pantoprazole because of interaction with omeprazole. # Tobacco abuse. Patient was given nicotine patch # COPD: Stable.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest pain. Your EKG and lab work showed that you had a heart attack, called myocardial infarction. You had 3 stents placed in the right artery of your heart to open this up and restore blood flow to your heart. You were started on new medications to help modify your risk for further heart disease. It is especially important for you to take aspirin and plavix daily for one year and possibly longer. Do not stop taking aspirin and plavix or miss any doses or the stent may clot off and cause another heart attack. You initially went to the ICU but you remained stable after the stents were placed and now you are ready to be discharged. You should follow-up with your doctors as ___ below. It is important to bring all your medications to each appointment so your doctors ___ update their records and adjust the doses as needed. The following changes were made to your medications: START TAKING THE FOLLOWING MEDS: - Aspirin 81 mg daily to keep the stent open and prevent another heart attack. - Plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily to keep the stent open and prevent another heart attack. - Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily to lower your heart rate - Increase rosuvastatin (Crestor) to 40 mg daily to lower your cholesterol . STOP TAKING THE FOLLOWING MEDS: -Celebrex- this medication is not good to take right after having a heart attack. If you need to take something for pain we recommend you take tylenol instead (maximum of 4g in one day) It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital! ","PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), osteoarthritis who presented with chest pressure found to be due to inferolateral ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with persistent hypotension after balloon inflation requiring dopamine. She was weaned off the dopamine during the first 24 hours post-cath and remained stable hemodynamically and chest pain free. ACTIVE PROBLEMS # STEMI- ST elevation in III greater than II, with ST depression in I, aVL suggested that right coronary artery was the culprit lesion. The patient had 3 ___ placed in the RCA but still had LCx 80% ostial OM1, 80% mid circumflex which was not treated given her hypotension (see below). In the cath lab, she was started on intregrillin which was continued for 12 hours and then discontinued. Her post-intervention echo showed preserved LV ejection fraction (60%) and no focal wall motion abnormalities. -New Medications: -Aspirin 81mg qday -Plavix 75mg po qday -Atorvastatin 80mg po qday -F/u the patient continues to have stenosis of the LCx and need for intervention on this can be addressed at follow-up with Dr. ___ #Blood pressure control: While in the cath lab, the patient had hypotension after inflating the balloon in RCA. Her right heart cath had normal pressures so a temporary vagal response was the most likely etiology of her hypotension. She was started on dopamine drip in the cath lab. PCWP was 10, so slight hypovolemia may have contributed- patient received a total of 1200 cc normal saline and was able to wean off dopamine drip within the first 24 hours. She had no evidence of infection to suggest sepsis as an etiology of hypotension. Her blood pressure was stable on her home regimen: lisinopril 10 mg daily and metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily. # Hyperlipidemia-Changed rosuvastatin to atorvastatin 80 mg daily for better risk factor modification. Admission CK was 253, AST/ALT 36/20, lipid panel LDL 60, HDL 70, ___ 137. # Osteoarthritis- Used acetaminophen for pain control; held Celebrex due to possible interaction with coronary artery disease. # Right knee ___ cyst: She continued to have pain behind right knee and exam was consistent with ___ cyst. Ultrasound confirmed this. Advised her to use tylenol for pain control. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Will likely need intervention to left circumflex - monitor for side effects of medications including muscle aches from atorvastatin and bleeding - monitor symptoms of osteoarthritis and consider changing pain regimen as an outpatient ",3072,614,12

Possible R field cut. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr. ___, You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion, headache, speech change resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGE, a condition where a bleed is found in the brain. The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from irritation from blood can cause various symptoms. We think that the bleed you had may have been due to the fact you were on warfarin as well as aspirin and Plavix. There was also an ischemic stroke in your cerebellum, which could have been caused by a clot travelling from your heart. Because of your hemorrhagic stroke, you can no longer be on Coumadin for now, which you had been on for atrial fibrillation. This is because of the risk of further bleeding. This risk can be reassessed in the future. You need a repeat MRI in 2 months to assess how much the bleeding has reabsorbed and to look for an underlying lesion. Your stroke mainly affected your speech, specifically finding the right words for things and being able to read. Your ability to see the right side may also have been affected. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: high blood pressure coronary artery disease high cholesterol atrial fibrillation (for stroke) warfarin use (for hemorrhage) We are changing your medications as follows: stop warfarin stop Plavix temporarily (restart plavix on ___ Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with HTN, HLD, and CAD as well as history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. On ___ he had been discharged from an OSH, on Plavix, lovenox bridge to warfarin following a BMS on ___ to the proximal circumflex artery. He presented to an OSH with headache, slurred speech, and confusion and was found to have a 3x3 cm left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema but no midline shift and was transferred to ___ for further care. His examination is significant for an expressive aphasia, which improved while he was present. Initially his spontaneous speech was slow and sparse but improved. He continued to have anomia, which was improving, as well as alexia, and some degree of agraphia though not as pronounced as his degree of alexia. He may have had a R field cut. He also had right nasolabial fold flattening. Strength and coordination were normal. His MRI brain w/ and w/o contrast also showed a cerebellar ischemic infarct ___ territory). Etiology of bleed could be cardioembolic in the periprocedural setting, possibly during the procedure, as there were two areas in different vascular territories. It is possible that the L parietal IPH was hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct, in the setting of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for his afib and stent, although this less likely. It could also have been spontaneous in the setting of triple therapy, though that would not explain the cerebellar ischemic infarct, or a combination of the two. The IPH appears more likely to be primary. There was no evidence of microhemorrhages on gradient echo sequences to suggest CAA at this time. Cardiology was consulted for recommendations on antiplatelet therapy in the setting of IPH. They recommended that he be restarted on aspirin and then Plavix when safe from a neurological perspective. He was restarted on aspirin, as his bleed was felt to be stable. He can be restarted on Plavix 75 mg daily as well 7 days post bleed, on ___. He will need to be re-evaluated in the future before it can be determined if it is safe for systemic anticoagulation. Cardiology had suggested that he be switched to coumadin and Plavix in the future, if safe for anticoagulation. He was evaluated by ___ who recommended rehab, which he was discharged to. His IPH was stable on repeat imaging. An Echo was not done because it was not felt that it would change management. UOP was initially low but resolved with fluids. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES IPH: Can restart Plavix for stent on ___ from bleed perspective. Outpatient MRI brain in ___ months prior to stroke appointment. Follow up in stroke clinic. Determine need/safety for systemic anticoagulation in ___. CAD s/p BMS ___ at OSH: Continue aspirin 81 mg daily. RESTART Plavix 75 mg daily on ___. Should be on ASA/Plavix for at least 1 month. Switch to coumadin/Plavix in the future if safe for anticoagulation from IPH perspective, per cardiology. AFib - home metoprolol was reduced to 50 mg TID initially, this can be titrated up to 75 mg TID (which he had been on) as required by his heart rates Urinary retention, low urine output: he had a foley which was discontinued on the morning of discharge. He was undergoing void trial. The foley can be replaced and void trials continued as required by his clinical status. complicated UTI - he had an abnormal UA with 51 WBCs, moderate ___, and was started on Bactrim DS 1 tab BID. Urine culture did not grow anything, so this was discontinued. Multiple predominantly peripheral pulmonary nodules ranging up to 8 mm in diameter - incidentally seen on CTA h/n. Consider further evaluation with CT chest as clinically indicated as an outpatient. He did not have any pulmonary issues while hospitalized. Transaminitis--attributed to known history of cirrhosis CRP elevated in the setting of hemorrhage and infarct. Repeat as outpatient. PCP ___ ",3058,913,12

He felt that he was becoming dehydrated. This morning he woke up at 7: 30 with a HA, and then while lying in bed developed ___ chest pressure. Over the next hour, it became worse, associated with SOB, nausea, diaphoresis, but without vomiting. He says this is similar to the pain he felt when he has had an MI, last in ___. He did not take any nitroglycerin as he says this does not work for his pain. He drove to the ED, and walking from his car to the ED, he said he was SOB and had to stop and sit down. . Per his cardiologist, Dr. ___ has had several hospitalizations in ___ for atrial fibrillation based on his automated blood pressure monitor showing an irregular heartbeat of 135. He complains of pressure in his chest as well as sweating, and on the first occasion, he had a stress test that was negative. With a similar event in ___, he had a slight increase in his troponin and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in ___ which showed no change in his coronary anatomy, and no intervention was performed. During one of his hospitalizations on ___, he had a 6-beat run of ventricular tachycardia during which he felt he was being punched in the chest. On a ___ monitor in ___, only normal sinus rhythm and a short run of PSVT was noted. His most recent hospitalization was just a few days ago in ___ with a typical dehydration episode that required several days of intravenous fluid rehydration. He reports 6 admissions with chest pressure and dehydration in the last 3 months in ___. He was last here in ___, with chest pressure thought to be ___ demand in setting of dehydration and required several liters of fluid.

You were admitted with chest pain. Your cardiac enzymes were checked and were normal. Your ECG was also normal. You were monitored overnight, and no arrhythmias were seen. You were found to be orthostatic, and were treated with fluids. Your chest pressure resolved after you were treated with fluids. You had some abdominal pain, but normal liver tests and the pain improved on its own. No medications were changed during this admission. Please continue all medications you were taking prior to admission. ***It is important that you increase your water intake to ___ daily. This should help to keep you well-hydrated. Please also increase the salt in your diet. We also advise that you use compression stockings as this can held with the lightheadedness while standing.**** ","___ yo M w/ CAD (see below, multiple PCIs), HTN, HL, Afib not on coumadin, pericarditis and cardiac fibrosis, mitochondrial myopathy, orthostatic intolerance and multiple recent admission for weakness, nausea, dehydration, presents with chest pressure similar to prior MI. . # CORONARIES: Presenting with chest pressure similar to previous MI, concerning for UA vs. NSTEMI vs. demand angina ___ dehydration vs. arrhythmia vs. PE. EKG in ED reported as having showed ST depressions in V4-V6, apparently new (though unable to locate that ECG as did not come up in chart). Repeat EKG while patient was CP free was not checked in the ED. NSTEMI less likely given that first troponins negative. Repeat EKG on floors while chest pain free showed no ST depression in leads V4-V6, and was sinus. He has had multiple admissions for nausea, chest pressure with dehydration. Orthostatic on admission with BP drop of 60 pts systolic, making dehydration and demand angina more likely. PE thought to be unlikely given no tachycardia, no pleuritic CP, no hypoxia, and no evidence on EKG. Arrhythmia associated with CP also possible, but in sinus bradycardia to high 50's, without events on telemetry. Troponins were negative x3. His repeat EKG was sinus bradycardia, unchanged. He was continued on home dose of ASA 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily. Lipids checked with LDL 61, TSH was 1.3, and A1c of 5.8. He was given aggressive fluid of 5L and symptoms completely resolved. He was continued on valsartan 80 bid, metoprolol succ 25 mg bid. Continued on antianginal Ranexa 500mg po bid (pt stated that Imdur previously has cause hypotension).

He reports a few days of myalgias and general weakness/fatigue. Along with this, he reports the sudden onset of chest pain, which he described a different from his angina. He took 1 SL NTG with some relief but, given the persistence of his symptoms, he presented to ___. Upon review of the ___ records, ED EKG showed 2: 1 a-flutter at a rate of 120 with RBBB. He had no chest pain in the ED there and no SOB, but he did report to the ED physician ___ sense of general malaise. He was also noted to have a fever of 101 in the ED. He was given Acetaminophen for the fever, a chest xray was obtained which was reportedly non-diagnostic as was a U/A. His labwork was notable for a Troponin T of 2.9, BNP 1070. He was thus transferred to ___ for further evaluation. In the ED, initial vitals were T97, HR 97, BP 105/68, RR 14, Sat 98% on 2L. His labwork was notable for a Troponin of 1.05, BUN/Cr 41/1.7, plts 140, Hgb 10.8, INR 1.4, PTT 37.4. He continued to have right shoulder pain and was given Morphine 4mg IV x 1. His blood pressure dropped to 87/56 after he received the morphine so he received a 500cc bolus with good BP response. Portable CXR showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with no effusions. On arrival to the floor, patient was stable but reported lightheadedness. Orthostatics at that time were normal and lightheadedness resolved. He went to the bathroom and was then found down, blue and pulseless with agonal breathing. CPR was initiated but patient regained consciousness quickly. No medications or shocks were administered. Rhythm was sinus with hemodynamics were stable. SBP was 140, oxygen sats were in the mid-90s, HR was 80-90s. Given syncopal event with unresponsiveness, he is being transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. On arrival to the CCU, patient's oxygen saturations were in the mid-high ___ on a NRB. He denied any shortness of breath or chest pain. ABG showed that he was oxygenating well (7.39/38/314/24). Sats improved to 98% on 2L at the time of this note. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema and syncope.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You had chest pain and was admitted to ___ with a heart attack. You were transferred to ___ and had a fainting episode in the bathroom. You were in an irregular heart rhythm, atrial fibillation, that was converted to a normal rhythm with an electrical cardioversion. You will need to have your heart rhythm checked regularly now. We started an anticoagulation pill called coumadin to prevent strokes from the atrial fibrillation and you developed a bleed somewhere in your GI tract. We were unable to localize the bleeding using a scope in your stomach and lower colon. It is very important that you follow a diabetic and low salt diet. This will prevent your blood sugars from being high and prevent the fluid from reaccumulating. Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. ___ if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. Your weight at discharge is 184 pounds. Please make an appt with your diabetes doctor soon to review your diet and insulin requirements. We were unable to perform a cardiac catheterization during this hospital stay because of your kidney function worsened. . We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. Increase Metoprolol to 150 mg daily 2. Increase Omeprazole to 40 mg twice daily 3. Increase aspirin to 325 mg daily ","___ male with history of CAD s/p CABG x 2 who presents from OSH with NSTEMI. Transferred to the CCU s/p syncopal event. . # Syncope: His transfer to the CCU was initiated because of a syncopal episode. Possible etiologies included vasovagal episode (he was baring down in the bathroom at the time), arrhythmia given his a-flutter/a-fib and sigificant cardiac history. He was not on tele at the time of the event, and he was found down, pulseless in the bathroom. Compressions were initiated and he quickly regained consciousness, and was lucid. He was not confused, and had no evidence of seizure activity. In the CCU, tele showed a-fib with RVR and was uptitrated to 75 TID of metoprolol tartrate and then initiated on a diltiazem drip. His rate slowed, but he remained in a-fib. He was put on a heparin drip and started on coumadin for a CHADS2 score of 3. He was DC cardioverted and remained in NSR through discharge. Of note, his anticoagulation was stopped in-house in the setting of developing LGIB (see below), and was discharged on beta blocker but no coumadin. He will require follow up for reassessment of his need for coumadin given his recent bleed. . # NSTEMI: Pt was first seen at ___ with 2 days of chest pain and was noted to have a positive troponin-I of 2.92. His troponin-T in the ___ ED was 1.05, prior troponins in ___ ranged from 0.05->0.23 in the setting of his renal dysfunction. His troponins remained elevated in the 1's but his CK decreased and his CK-MB were normal. He also had renal dysfunction, likely contributing to his poor clearance of troponins. In the setting of his renal function, cath was deferred, but may be considered in the future. He was d/c'd on beta blocker (metoprolol succinate increased to 150mg daily from home dose of 100mg), asa, satin. . #LGIB: Pt noted to have Guaiac positive stools and occasional BRBPR. His Hct was noted to drop from 33.5-->26.5 over the course of 1 day and received a total of 1 U PRBC with good response. Pt had both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy which was only significant for antral erosisons but no obvious source of bleed. His anticoagulation was held and he was continued on PPI which was increased to BID on discharge. After endoscopy, he had no further signs of bleeding and hct stable at ___. H pylori was negative. He was set up with GI follow up. . #Acute on chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Pt with echo in-house showing worsening LVEF to 40% compared to prior echo. He was noted to be volume overloaded in house requiring diuresis with metolazone and toresemide, along with home dose of spironalactone. Over the course of his CCU and floor stay he diuresed well and became more euvolemic after transfer back to the floor. He was discharged on a regimen of torsemide 60 mg daily, with instructions to take an additional 40mg as needed, as well as home spironalactone of 25 mg daily. He was told to follow up with Dr. ___ in heart failure clinic. . # Fever/leukocytosis: He spiked a fever overnight on the night of his transfer to the CCU to ___. He had pan cultures taken (blood, urine, sputum) and a chest x-ray was done, but no focal source was identified. Antibiotics were initially held in the setting of a lack of source/bug, and given his hemodynamic stability. Given the presentation of malaise and myalgias it was thought that he had a viral syndrome. . # Hypoxia: He was hypoxic to the the high 80's on NRB initially on transfer to the CCU, and was able to be weaned without intervention to 2L NC and maintained sats in the low to mid ___. PE was considered as well as CHF exacerbation, ACS, hypoventilation, methemoglobinemia, and COPD. Because of his normal ABG and his normal methemoglobin, as well as his downtrending CK-MBs he was thought to be overloaded. He had been in a-fib with RVR, with likely poor forward flow. He had increased crackles on exam and required diuresis with good improvement in his respiratory status. . # CKD: Patient has stage III CKD thought to be secondary to CHF. He is followed by Dr. ___ as an outpatient. Creatinine at baseline on arrival (1.7) and increased likely secondary to poor forward flow to as high as 2.3. He was continued on home spironalactone, torsemide, and metolazone, and his Cr improved to 1.8 on discharge . # DM II: He was continued on his home regimen of Lantus BID (40qAM, 50qPM) and ISS. . # Hypothyroidism: Continued on Levothyroxine 280mcg qAM. TSH was WNL. . # Depression: Continued on home sertraline ",4108,1163,12
18086903-DS-19,"<SEX> M <SERVICE> NEUROLOGY <ALLERGIES> Crestor / atorvastatin <ATTENDING> ___ <CHIEF COMPLAINT> Bilateral lower extremity weakness, slurred speech and confusion <MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURE> None <HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS> ___ RHM who presents to the ED with resolving bilateral lower extremity weakness, slurred speech and confusion on a background of stroke, severe vasculopathy, poorly treated DM, HTN, HL, right CEA, paroxysmal afib. He was recently admitted to ___ (___) for chest pain and shortness of breath and underwent Cardiac cath that showed extensive and worsening coronary disease. CABG was considered but he was not thought to be a good candidate for either CABG or ""high-risk stenting"". It was decided that he would be managed medically with aspirin/plavix and statin. Since discharge he has continued to require sublingual nitro every ___ days for chest pain (he reports good and prompt benefit). Otherwise he has been roughly at his baseline with intermittent and fluctuating swelling in his legs. He does report increased tremors in his hands. Perhaps 2 days ago, he noted weakness in both legs but mostly on the right. He states that he sometimes notices swelling and tingling in his lower extremities but that his legs have never felt weak like this beforehand. He felt weak in his proximal lower extremities but NOT the feet and noted that he had significant difficulty walking and needed to brace himself on stationary objects. He denies vertigo or imbalance or lightheadedness. He denies falls or increased back pain. He denies sensory changes (other than mild chronic tingling associated with leg swelling) He acknowledges some degree of discomfort in the legs during this time but is adamant (despite documented call-in to cardiology on ___ in ___) that he did NOT have leg cramps or pain and that he stopped the statin because of GI upset. His narrative at this point is slightly inconsistent as he at times both denies pain but also states that he stopped the medication (simvastatin) because of pain and stiffness in his legs. At any rate, the next day he continued to have difficulty ambulating and spent most of the day on the couch hoping he would improve after stopping the statin. Despite his disability, he was able to make it to the bathroom on his own without walker/cane or assistance from family members. He denies changes in urinary/bowel function during this time or saddle anesthesia. He has a prior history of adverse side-effects from statins (crestor ,lipitor), noting significant myalgias (back pain and stiffness). He reports that these myalgias were different than his current discomfort. He denies any symptoms whatsoever in his upper extremities. Earlier today, his daughter called him at 1pm to visit and he appeared to exhibit strange behavior over the phone. She noted that he was repeating himself and seemed slightly confused and ""slow"" with notable latency in answering her questions. He also appeared to have slurred speech -but no paraphasic errors noted and he was generally able to understand her. He apparently had not had anything to eat at this point in the day day and, given that he is a diabetic on insulin, there was some concern that his sugar might be low (he did not use his glucometer at this point). She told him to eat and went over to see him and by this point he had had 3 packets of cheese and crackers and his confusion/slurred speech seemed to have improved. His BG at this point was >300mg/dl. However he continued to exhibit difficulty walking on his own and there was concern for stroke and he was brought in to the ED. By the time of his arrival at ___, his confusion had improved and his cognitive abilities had pretty much returned to baseline. His lower extremity weakness had also improved to some degree but his gait remained, by his account, quite impaired. He has a history of a stroke/""TIA"" ___ years prior which presented as left facial droop (could not remember if arm was involved as well) he reports no lingering deficits from this one event (only known stroke). Of note, he also was told to hold his aspirin/plavix for several days last week in the setting of a dental appointment after which he restarted both these medications. He has otherwise been compliant and there were no other changes to his medication (other than stopping the statin). On ROS, he states that he has had fluctuating facial numbness on the left side of his face ""on and off for the past few years"". He also endorses relatively frequent headaches that have increased in frequency over the last few weeks. He does not report any fever, chills or other signs/symptoms of infection. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> 1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension, +Diabetes (A1c 9.60 on ___ 2.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr. ___, You were admitted to ___ on ___ due to leg weakness. Your symptoms resolved shortly after you arrived but your CT scan showed multiple areas concerning for strokes so you were admitted to the neurology service for further evaluation. We were unable to obtain an MRI as we could not determine whether all of your stents are MRI compatible. Your strokes have likely happened over time and are unlikely to explain your leg weakness. However you do have multiple risk factors for stroke including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. You should follow up with your cardiologist as scheduled and with neurology (see below). We did not change any of your medications. If you experience any of the below listed danger signs, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department. It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay. ","Mr. ___ is a ___ RHM with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, vasculopathy s/p right carotid enarterectomy, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED with resolving bilateral lower extremity weakness, slurred speech and confusion. # NEURO: He claims that his right lower extremity was weaker than his left. A couple of days prior to this admission, he stopped taking his statin because he had worsening leg cramps and GI symptoms like diarrhea and constipation. He has had difficulty tolerating statins in the past. He was recently hospitalized in ___ of this year for chest pain. During that admission, he had a cardiac catheterization that revealed severe and worsening coronary artery disease. He was not considered a good candidate for CABG or ""high risk"" stenting. In the emergency room, head CT revealed hypodensities in the right occipital lobe that could represent subacute infarcts. MRI could not be performed because records from his previous vascular surgeries regarding the type of stents that were implanted in his subclavian and femoral artery bypass surgeries could not be obtained. His stroke risk factors were assessed and his HbA1c was 9.0% and LDL was 128. He had a recent transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no ASD or thrombus. His left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 40%. His home Aspirin and Plavix were resumed. His outpatient cardiologist was contacted. His cardiologist confirmed that he does not have a history of atrial fibrillation. He recommended against starting anticoagulation in addition to Aspirin and Plavix. He will not be restarted on a statin given his history of adverse reactions. Also, he had a recent (1month ago) carotid ultrasound, revealing <40% stenosis on the right, and 40-59% on the left). His exam was essentially non focal and he was able to walk without difficulty. AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 1. Dysphagia screening before any PO intake?

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest pain which was concerning for blockage within your previous bypass grafts. You were evaluated with a cardiac catheterization which found 90% blockage of one of your grafts and 80% blockage of another graft. . The 90% blockage was stented, and you will need to take plavix for ___ year to keep the stent open. The other 80% blockage could not be stented because the vessel was too small. We cannot be sure which of these blockages was causing your symptoms, so it is possible that you will still have chest pain. You started a new medication to help with the chest pain, called Imdur. . The following changes were made to your medications: - CHANGE valsartan to losartan 25 mg daily - CHANGE atenolol to metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 25 mg daily for blood pressure and heart rate - START clopidogrel (plavix) 75 mg daily to keep your stent from clotting - CONTINUE aspirin 81 mg (full dose) daily - START atorvastatin 80 mg daily for high cholesterol - START isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur) 30 mg daily for chest pain and your blood pressure . It is also very important that you keep all of the follow-up appointments listed below. Bring your medications to each appointment so that your outpatient doctors ___ update their records and make adjustments if necessary. . It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital! ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post 4Vessel bypass (CABG) ___ years ago who presented with exertional chest pain x 1.5 weeks, concerning for unstable angina. He underwent cardiac cath and recieved a DES in his OM1 graft with a second 80% occlusion found in his PDA graft that could not be intervened upon. . # CAD: Had CABG ___ years ago. He has a story which was concerning for unstable angina and he was evaluated by cardiology in the ED who recommended aspirin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel loading with 300 mg x 1 and then 75 mg daily, as well as a heparin drip. He was able to become chest pain free after nitro SL. He remained without ischemic changes on his EKG and with 2 troponins negative. He underwent cardiac cath on ___ which showed 90% occlusion of his OM1 graft, which was stented. He also had 80% occlusion of his PDA graft which could not be intervened on because it was too small of a vessel and with oganized thrombus. He continued to have chest pressure with radiation to his jaw after the cath and because PDA vessel could not be intervened on, he was started on isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily for symptomatic relief. His last echo was ___ years ago with a normal EF (60%) and no valvular disease and he did not have symptoms or signs of failure so this was not repeated. His home blood pressure medication, valsartan 80 mg daily was decreased to losartan 25 mg daily in favor of symptomatic anginal control and blood pressure management with the Imdur. Also, atenolol was changed to metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. These changes achieved goal blood pressure less than 130s and heart rate less than ___. He was also started on atorvastatin because his lipid panel showed LDL 91, HDL 39 and his AST/ALT were mildly elevated to ___ with normal CK. His discharge medications were: aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, losartan 25 mg daily, and isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily. . CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Hypertension: Well controlled during admission. Continued home valsartan 80 mg daily and changed home atenolol to metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. When we started Imdur 30 mg daily he had symptomatic hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the ___. Thus, his valsartan was decreased to losartan 25 mg daily in favor of using the imdur to control blood pressure 100s-130s while also achieving anginal symptom relief. . # Gastroesophageal reflux disease: no symptoms, continued protonix 40 mg daily. . EMERGENCY CONTACT: wife and HCP: ___, ___ h . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please make sure that he continues to take his atorvastatin for risk factor modification - Please uptitrate his isosorbide mononitrate as needed for persistent anginal symptoms and as his blood pressure will tolerate ",2644,714,12

ECGs and blood tests were performed and did not show any evidence of a heart attack or new damage to your heart. You were also sent for a stress test which was negative and a cardiac perfusion study which showed a damaged area in your heart, most likely from your previous heart attack in ___. You should follow up with your primary care doctor within ___ days after discharge. Because of your recent loss and the significant stress you are under, you should also follow up with your counselor as soon as possible after discharge. Please stop taking the following medications: Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY Please start taking the following medications: Aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily Miconazole 2% Powder. Apply to affected area twice daily for 4 weeks. Nicotine 14 mg / 24 hours Patch. Apply one patch every 24 hours. Please continue taking all of your prescribed medications. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking Alprazolam or narcotic medications such as Percocet. ","The patient is a ___ year old female with a history of premature CAD and a prior STEMI in ___ with a 99% mid RCA lesion and Cypher stent placement. Since then, she has had several admissions for chest pain in the setting significant stressors that were found to be non-cardiac in nature. She presented today with chest pain shortly after the funeral of a close childhood friend who was murdered. Cardiac enzymes were negative and EKG showed no evidence of new ischemia. Stress testing with perfusion imaging showed limited functional capacity and findings consistent with her prior MI in ___. . # Chest Pain: History of prior RCA lesion and recent symptoms are concerning for ACS, but EKG showed no new ischemic changes and several sets of cardiac enzymes were negative. Given her past presentations and the association of her current symptoms with significant stress at home, panic attack is another reasonable diagnosis to consider, though the persistence of the chest pain for hours would be atypical. Her clinical stability, imaging, and labs argue against other possible causes of chest pain such as PE, aortic dissection, pleurisy, and pneumothorax. Musculoskeletal pain was also considered, and her chest pain did respond to warm packs, Toradol, and Percocet. She has Percocet at home for fibromyalgia symptoms, so no new prescription was given at discharge. . # CAD: Significant cardiac history and presentation concerning for ACS, but cardiac enzymes and EKG were negative. An exercise stress test on ___ showed no ischemic ECG changes and non-anginal symptoms were reported. Her functional capacity during the test was limited. Perfusion imaging showed an LVEF of 45% and a moderate size minimally reversible defect in the inferolateral wall with no other defects noted. The findings likely represented sequelae of her prior MI in ___. Medical management was continued with her home regimen as below except that she was switched to Aspirin 81 mg daily from 325 mg daily. -- Aspirin 81 mg PO daily -- Clopidogrel 75 mg PO DAILY -- Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID -- Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO DAILY -- Atorvastatin 80 mg PO DAILY . # HLD: Continued home Lipitor 80 mg PO daily . # Depression / Anxiety: History of depression and anxiety with recent severe stress including the murder of a close friend, daughter leaving for college, and fiance leaving her. A social work evaluation was ordered while an inpatient, and close followup with her outpatient therapist was recommended. Her outpatient medication regimen was continued including Fluoxetine 60 mg PO DAILY and Alprazolam 0.5 mg PO TID PRN anxiety. . # Asthma: She has a history of asthma treated with an Albuterol inhaler, but also reports prior evaluation for possible COPD. No such records were found from ___ reports, however. Starting an inhaled steroid was discussed with the patient, but she reported poor tolerance of inhaled steroids in the past and prefered Albuterol. . # Breast Rash: The patient had an pruritic, erythematous rash under her left breast consistent with a fungal skin infection. She was started on a topical antifungal regimen on ___. A prescription for Miconazole 2% Powder One Applicator TP BID was provided at discharge. . # Smoking Cessation: The patient smokes approximately ___ packs of cigarettes per day and requested a Nicotine patch while in the hospital. Smoking cessation health benefits and options were discussed and she was provided a prescription for Nicotine patches upon discharge. . ",3639,756,12

Selective coronary angiography demonstrated in this left dominant system demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had 40% ostial stenosis. The LAD had a mid 30% stenosis. The LCX had a mid 70%, 95% major OM1. The RCA was small non dominant. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated right and left elevated filling pressures with RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 22 mmHg. The PCWP was elevated at baseline 16 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension at rest, with PASP 45 mmHg. the cardiac output was low, with CI 1.79 L/min/m2. There was severe aortic stenosis with peak gradient of 60 mmHg and a calculated aortic valve of 0.4 cm2. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. 3. Severe aortic stenosis. . CXR (___) AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Hyperinflation reflects COPD. No focal pulmonary abnormality. Technical artifact produces misregistration at the lung bases not to be mistaken for pneumothorax or other abnormality. There is no pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal aside from atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta. . ECHO (___) Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is significant aortic valve stenosis. Peak and mean gradients place AS in the moderate range, though precise calculation of valve area is limited by technically-suboptimal LVOT jet velocity measurement. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Very limited study. Normal global biventricular systolic function. Aortic stenosis, probably moderate. . CHEST CT (___) IMPRESSION: 1. Several bilateral pulmonary nodules, including dominant 8 and 10 mm right apical nodules. In the setting of apical scarring, the apical nodules could potentially be due to nodular scarring. However, in the setting of emphysema, PET-CT should be considered for further evaluation in order to exclude a primary lung cancer. 2. Mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema in the upper lobes. Apparent coexisting panlobular emphysema in lower lobes. Considering coexisting moderate bronchiectasis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should be considered. 3. Severe aortic valve and coronary artery calcifications. 4. Bilateral hypodense adrenal nodules, most consistent with adenomas. 5. Anterior wedge compression fracture of vertebral body T12, age indeterminate, as no priors are available for comparison. . ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___ Suboptimal image quality. Significant aortic stensosis. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the peak transaortic velocity has increased from 2.8 m/s to 3.9 m/s and the peak transaortic pressure gradient has increased from 32 mmHg to 60 mmHg. These findings are more consistent with the visual appearance of the aortic valve with severely thickened leaflets and limited leaflet mobility (at least severe aortic stenosis visually and by velocities/transvalvular gradients), however in the absence of a measurement of the LVOT ___ and a peak LVOT velocity tracing a definitive measurement of the aortic valve area cannot be made. . CARDIAC CATHETERISATION ___ 1. Severe aortic stenosis 2. Successful balloon valvuloplasty of aortic valve with 22mm Tyshak II balloon with improvement in SBP and gradient 3. Successful LFA angioseal. 4. Plan for PCI LCx later in week. . CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS ___ Study: Carotid Series Complete Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries. On the right there is moderate heterogeneous plaque seen in the ICA . On the left there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen in the ICA. On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 120/24, 95/27, 106/16, cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 106 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 196 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.1 . These findings are consistent with 40-59% stenosis. On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 68/15, 85/22, 76/28, cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 100 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 108 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is .85 . These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis. There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow. There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow. Impression: Right ICA 40-59% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis. . <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> simvastatin, nifedipine, advair, spiriva (does not know dosages). <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. 2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation. 3. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose Disk with Device Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation twice a day. 4. warfarin 3 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. 5. atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. 6. clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. 7. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia. 8. tiotropium bromide 18 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device Sig: One (1) Cap Inhalation DAILY (Daily). 9. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) vial Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing. 10. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) vial Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing. 11. tamsulosin 0.4 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime) for 1 weeks. 12. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

A catheterization showed a very tight aortic valve and multiple blockages in your heart arteries. A valvuloplasty was done to open the valve and two bare metal stents were placed in one of your heart arteries which was thought to be the artery responsible for your heart attack. You are on many new medicines to prevent another heart attack and a stroke. It is extremely important for you to take these medicines every day. You had some fluid overload because of the heart attack that was treated with a diuretic to remove the extra fluid. Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. You were found to be in an irregular heart rhythm called atrial flutter, amiodarone was started to help regulate the rhythm and warfarin was started to prevent a stroke from the rhythm. . You had trouble urinating and a catheter was replaced in your bladder. It will stay in a week and then be removed again. You will need to see a urologist if you are still having trouble after one week. We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. STOP taking nifedipine and simvastatin 2. START aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) to keep the stent open. Do not miss any doses or stop taking clopidogrel for any reason unless Dr. ___ you it is OK 3. START taking atrovastatin to lower your cholesterol 4. START taking tamsulosin to decrease the swelling in your prostate 5. START taking amiodarone to regulate your heart rhythm 6. START taking senna and colace to prevent constipation 7. START taking warfarin to prevent a stroke from the aflutter 8. START taking albuterol and ipratroprium as needed for wheezing. 9.

Here found 95% likely culprit major OM1 lesion and critical AS. . # NSTEMI/low CI: He had no further chest pain during his hospitalisation here. CK-MB was flat at 5. He underwent cardiac catheterisation which showed critical AS and OM1 stenosis, and underwent spaced aortic valvuloplasty and bare metal stenting of his OM1 during this hospitalisation. These procedures were successful. He was started on aspirin, plavix, atorvastatinno further chest pain. Plan for PCI to OM1 on today. On ASA, plavix, statin. Beta blocker was not started due to starting amiodarone for rate/rhythm control of atrial fibrillation. He was also started on a heparin drip and transitioned to warfarin. . # Critical AS: Cardiac catheterisation revealed critical aoritc stenosis. He was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery for possible valve replacement, but felt not to be an operative candidate on account of porcelain aorta and significant COPD/ emphysema. The patient underwent valvuloplasty with 50% reduction in gradient. He tolerated the procedure well and has been stable since. . # Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter, and was started on amiodarone, which he will receive TID until ___. Subsequently, please decrease his amiodarone dose to 200 daily. He was also started on a heparin drip and transitioned to warfarin, which he will continue following discharge. . # COPD: On spiriva/advair at home. O2 sat >95% on RA here. He had occasional wheeze but no dyspnea or cough. He was continued on albuterol and ipratropium nebulisers and treated with advair and spiriva during his hospitalisation. . # Pulmonary nodules: found on CT concerning for malignancy. This finding was discussed with patient and family. He will need to followup with a PET-CT as an outpatient. . # Hyperlipidemia: was on simvastatin at home, this was changed to atorvastatin 80 mg post-MI. . # Urinary obstruction: Patient had poor urine output, but had >800 cc residual urine in his bladder. Foley catheter was placed; when removal was attempted, he failed a voiding trial. Foley catheter was therefor replaced and he will have a furtehr voiding trial in rehab. Tamsulosin was started to treat BPH. . # Psychosocial: he was seen by social work and provided with support regarding coping following his new diagnosis. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1. Patient is starting warfarin for atrial fibrillation and will need INR monitoring and appropriate warfarin dose titration following discharge. 2. During his hospitalisation, he was ntoed to have urinary retention and foley catheter was placed. Please perform a voiding trial in ___ days and remove foley catheter as tolerated. 3.

She says the chest pain started 3 days ago, felt like pins, left sided, radiated to the left arm, and felt similar to the pain that prompted her stress test and eventual stenting in the past. The pain was ___ and occurred when she got out of her bed; she took ASA and it went away, but returned when she was exerting herself while getting her great granddaughter ready for school. She took a NTG, and this resolved the pain. Pain was associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, but not nausea or vomiting. Same chest pain started again while sitting on a chair and she took another NTG with good relief. She was able to sleep throughout the night without any problems. The following day, same situation occurred - she woke up and felt pain when she got up from her bed and had to take several aspirins throughout the day. Pain was worse with exertion. She had no symptoms all of yesterday and today. She presented to ED today because her children prompted her to. For about a year, she has had shortness of breath and chest pressure that starts when she walks. She notes that it is worse when she walks up hill than when she walks on flat ground. No cough or fever. No leg swelling or pain that is different from her usual arthritis pain. In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.0 HR 108 BP 144/73 RR 16 SaO2 98% on RA. CXR was unremarkable.

You were admitted to the hospital because of several episodes of chest pain. You underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed complete closure of two vessels. You have new vessels that supply the area of the heart the closed vessels used to supply. This means that this has been going on for a long time and so we did not open those lesions. We will continue to manage your symptoms with medical management as we discussed. Please continue to take all your medications. In addition, it is very IMPORTANT that you stop smoking. Smoking can worsen your coronary artery disease. It can also worsen your lung disease ","___ with h/o CAD s/p DES to RCA, diabetes mellitus, hypertension presents with chest pain that starts at rest and has been worsened with exertion. # Chest pain: patient's CAD risk factors include diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and ongoing smoking. Unlike her previous exertional angina, her chest pain has been persistent and occurring at rest. Troponin x 2 was negative and with no acute ischemic changes in EKG. TIMI risk score was 5 (for age, 3 risk factors, known CAD, severe angina, ASA for 7 days). Last nuclear stress test was in ___ and showed moderate, mostly reversible perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and apex. Given her symptoms and risk factors, we recommended coronary angiography. This showed RCA diffusely diseased with 60% proximal stenosis followed by chronic total occlusion in its mid segment and LCx with known chronic total occlusion in its mid portion; collaterals were present. Given chronicity of these lesions, optimization of medical management was recommended. Her metoprolol succinate was titrated up to 100 mg daily. She was continued on her home ASA, atorvastatin, plavix, isosorbide mononitrate, and lisinopril. Post-procedure check was unremarkable. She remained asymptomatic since arrival to floor through discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES # Type II diabetes mellitus: HbA1c was 6.9% in ___. She is on metformin at home. Patient was kept on a sliding scale while hospitalized. # Tobacco abuse/? COPD: Patient was interested in quitting and using a nicotoine patch. This was begun with plan to continue at home. Her last PFTs on ___ were within normal limits. However, compared to prior from ___, there had been a decline in FEV1 by about 240 mL, which may represent interval worsening obstruction. She was continued on her home ipratropium bromide and albuterol. # Multiple pulmonary nodules: Nodules have been stable for about ___ years (most recent scan ___ and will need to be reevaluated again in ___. # GERD/hiatal hernia: continued on home rabeprazole #TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -metoprolol succinate uptitrated to 100 mg daily -please continue to optimize medical management of CAD as needed -please continue to encourage smoking cessation CODE: full CONTACT: ___ (daughter) ___ ",3082,527,12

He has been sleeping a lot and appeared pale and unwell. He thought he just had a cold. He had been complaining of pressure in his epigastric region. On ___, his daughter realized that he had chest pressure and discomfort so he was brought to the ED at ___. At ___, patient was found to have a subacute STEMI with Q waves and ST elevation/T wave inversion in leads II. III, aVF. Troponin was up to 15.1, then peaked to 17 and decreased to 15.5. He was started on a heparin drip and was loaded with full dose aspirin. Cardiac cath was done on ___ which showed 90% stenosis in LAD anterior diagonal branches, 100% stenosis in RCA. Plavix was held for possible CABG. He was continued on aspirin, heparin, atorvastatin. His blood pressure was soft in the ___. TTE showed EF 60%. He received Lasix 20 mg IV x1 on ___. CT chest was positive for trace to small bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral interstitial patchy opacities. He was also found to have biapical consolidative opacities, right greater than left which may have been present in previous x-rays from ___. This was thought to be scarring/fibrosis versus neoplasm. CT surgery thought patient to be at high risk of mortality at 26.8% so he was a poor candidate for CABG. He was thought to be confused on ___ overnight. He was noted to be alert and oriented the next morning per medicine. Daughter thought he was last normal on ___ morning. On ___ at 10: 45 AM, daughter noted that pt was more confused, less responsive, and had slight worsening of his baseline L sided weakness. He said nonsensical things and seemed to be moving his left arm less than usual. On ___ at 10: 55 AM, a code stroke was called. CT ___ did not show acute hemorrhage or infarct. CTA ___ and neck showed extensive atherosclerosis with critical stenosis of the right ICA and 70% stenosis of the left ICA. Neurology assessed patient and noted decreased alertness, pronator drift of LUE/LLE and right gaze preference but it was unclear whether it was a partially residual deficit from prior stroke in ___. NIHSS was 6 (1 pt for lethargy, 1 pt for incorrect age, 1 pt for R gaze preference, 2 pts for LUE/LLE drift, 1 pt for tactile extinction to DSS).

No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or significant mass effect. 2. There is increased mean transit time >6 seconds within the right frontal and parietal lobes which may reflect watershed ischemia with possible small infarcts. 3. Mild focal narrowing of the left proximal M1 segment, likely related to atherosclerosis. Otherwise, the circle of ___ appears patent without definite evidence of stenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm. 4. Severe atherosclerotic disease at the right carotid bifurcation with focal severe approximately 80% stenosis of the right proximal internal carotid artery by noncalcified plaque/thrombus (more likely a plaque than a thrombus ). The right internal carotid artery reconstitutes distally. This finding is unchanged in comparison to recent outside prior CTA of the neck. 5. Prominent mixed calcified and noncalcified plaque formation at the left carotid bifurcation with approximately 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery by NASCET criteria. 6. Bilateral pulmonary findings suspicious for infectious process versus aspiration event. Please correlate clinically. CXR ___: IMPRESSION: New pulmonary edema as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. Superimposed aspiration/pneumonia would be hard to exclude in the proper clinical context. TTE Echo ___: CONCLUSION: The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall and mid inferolateral segment (see schematic). Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 53 % (normal 54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP greater than 18 mmHg). Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular regional dysfunction consistent with single vessel coronary artery disease. Moderate aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

MRSA SCREEN (Final ___: No MRSA isolated. KEY IMAGING: ___: Portable CXR In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved lung volumes. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, more prominent on the right, consistent with pulmonary edema as suggested in the clinical history. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms with basilar opacification is consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Given the extensive changes described above, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed aspiration/pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. ___: MR ___ Involving the right frontal lobe, right basal ganglia, right temporal lobe adjacent to the posterior aspect of the temporal horn and within the right occipital lobe adjacent to the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle. Additional tiny infarcts are noted within the genu of the corpus callosum, the right greater than left high posterior frontal lobes and high right parietal lobe. There is both cortical and white matter involvement. Some of the infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere are compatible with watershed etiology, and others appear embolic. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No significant mass effect. No shift of midline structures. Additional periventricular, deep, and subcortical T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities which do not restrict diffusion are nonspecific but likely represent small vessel ischemic changes. There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggestive of involutional changes. Major vascular flow voids are grossly preserved. There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells and right maxillary sinus. Status post lens replacement bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Numerous small acute infarcts, predominantly involving the right hemispheric watershed distributions, but also with an embolic component in the right cerebral hemisphere and left frontal lobe. No associated mass effect or blood products. ___: Carotid artery ultrasound Right ICA 40-59% stenosis. Left ICA 70-79% stenosis. ___: Left cardiac catheterization Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on a planned basis based on coronary angiographic findings documented on a prior angiogram. A 6 ___ EBU3.5 guide provided adequate support. Crossed with a Sion Blue into D1 and Prowater wire in D2 and Runthrough wire into the distal LAD. Predilated with a 2.0 am 2.5 mm balloons and then deployed a mm 2.5 x mm 24 DES. There was significant difficulty post-dilating as the patient moved his wrist several times prolapsing all of the equipment out several times. As such the stents needed to be recrossed several times and NS balloons would not cross. Eventually, using a Guideliner and an inchworm technique, a 3.0 mm balloon was used to postdilate. Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis. There was slow flow in the apex without wire passage into this area likely due to distal embolization. Findings: Successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the LAD coronary artery. ___: Portable CXR In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification in the upper zones bilaterally, consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there is increasing pulmonary edema. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle with poor definition the hemidiaphragms with pleural fluid and atelectatic changes at the right base. ___: Transthoracic echocardiogram There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is a small to moderate area of regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mid anterolateral wall and apex (see schematic) and preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 47% (normal 54-73%). Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel CAD. Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now slightly more pronounced. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> HOME MEDICATIONS: Plavix 75 mg daily Atorvastatin 80 mg QHS Vitamin D3 Alendronate 10 mg daily Cetirizine 10 mg daily At OSH: Heparin drip at 800U/hr Aspirin 81 mg daily Atorvastatin 80 mg QHS <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1.

Unstable angina with ECG changes concerning for STEMI <DISCHARGE CONDITION> Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ ___, You were admitted to the hospital after being diagnosis with inferior STEMI and worsening left side weakness in the setting of carotid stenosis at an outside hospital. You had a stent placed in your LAD for your unstable angina in the setting of a STEMI. A transcarotid artery revascularization was also performed to help with your carotid stenosis. The stent placed in your carotid artery will help keep the artery open so that blood can flow to the brain. To perform the procedure, a small incision was made in your neckline and it will continue to heal on its own. Discharge Information Preventing a Blood Clot in the Stent -After getting a stent, you need to take aspirin and Ticagrelor medicines that work to prevent blood clots from forming on the carotid and LAD stent. -Important: Do not stop taking aspirin and Ticagrelor without discussing it with the doctor who did your carotid stent procedure. Incision Site Care For one week: -Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot tub if your incision in submerged -Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around the puncture site. -Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. -Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the puncture site. You may have a small bruise around the incision site. This is normal and will go away one-two weeks. Call your doctor right away if you have swelling, bleeding, drainage or discomfort at the incision site that is new or increasing. Call if you feel increasing swelling, erythema, or any discharge or drainage from the wound or if you have a temperature of 101 or more. Activity For the first 48 hours: -Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure For the first week: -Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 pounds -Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles. Take care not to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, or moving your bowels. After one week: -You may go back to all your regular activities, including sexual activity. We suggest you begin your exercise program at half of your usual routine for the first few days. You may then gradually work back to your full routine.

Patient remained euvolemic preop and given metoprolol, ASA 81mg, ticagrelor 90mg, and atorvastatin along with a heparin drip. The procedure was complicated by difficulty with the device delivery requiring multiple re-wiring of the distal tortuous vessel; this however resulted in successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the LAD coronary artery. Troponin levels continued to trend down after CCU transfer. First day after PCI patient was hypotensive with MAPs in the high ___ to low ___ and metoprolol was held. Repeat EKG showed improving ST elevations anteriorly and inferiorly and CXR obtained on ___ was suspicious for RUL pneumonia in the setting of no leukocytosis and remaining afebrile during admission, antibiotics were held. MRSA and UATs negative. Post-myocardial infarction secondary prevention medications were titrated. Repeat TTE on ___ evaluating for wall motion abnormalities in the LAD territory revealed EF of 47% and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel CAD. Upon stabilization of cardiac status, patient was scheduled by vascular surgery for TCAR to be done on ___ concerning the right carotid stenosis. He was then transferred to vascular surgery for post-operative management of his TCAR. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ On ___ patient underwent Right transcervical carotid artery stenting with flow reversal. The operation went as expected and after a short stay in the PACU the patient arrived to the floor. Postoperative check was unremarkable with no new neurological deficits. The incision site was c/d/I with no noticeable hematoma. He continued to do well except for intermittent episodes of hypotension that were asymptomatic and responded to fluid bolus. On POD 1 he continued to do well, with slight improvement in his left extremity weakness, and remained hemodynamically stable. Staples were removed, and wound redressed. Throughout the rest of his hospitalization Mr. ___ continued to do well with intact neurological exam except for the residual left extremity weakness that continued to improve. He remained hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, and ambulating with a walked and assistance. ___ recommended rehab, and continued to work with Mr. ___ until his discharge to rehab facility. Of note the daughter brought up a concern for a lung opacity that was originally seen on chest imaging from an outside hospital. The images appear to be stable, but we recommended an outpatient follow up with pulmonary clinic for evaluation. An appointment was made for him prior to discharge. He continued to be on SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis and was started on aspirin and ticagrelor in the hospital on which he was sent home with. Ideally he would continue to take the ticagrelor for 12 months per cardiology, but should be on it for at least 6 months. He will be follow as an outpatient by cardiology as well as vascular surgery for continue postop optimization. At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.

This is in the context of two recent admissions, one with nausea and vomting found secondary to diverticulitis and another with similar nausea and vomiting that was found to relate to a myocardial infarction. This time she presents with similar nausea and vomiting and, as with the two previous admission, there was no chest pain. Last night, Mrs. ___ went out for dinner with a friend. They went to '___' in ___. She had two glasses of wine - the first time that she has had anything to drink since her heart attack. She does not know if her friend is unwell but plans to call. She did not sleep well last night and awoke feeling nauseous at about 5: 30 a.m. She drank some Coke and took an Ativan and two of her other regular BID medications (she was not specific). Her nausea did not relent. She vomited the Coke (and presumably the pills). Vomitus was non-bloody and non-bilious. It was very similar to her last presentation that was attributed to myocardial ischemia, which also, as now, appeared in the absence of chest pain. This time she also has had some mild shortness of breath. She decided that she would not wait but come straight to the ED in case this was another MI. She took 325 mg aspirin prior to calling the EMS. She presented with hypotension (98/71) but otherwise unremarkable vitals, 1 mm elevation in V2 and new T-wave inversion in V2, V3, and V4. Troponin was 0.65. She was given aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and started on a heparin drip. She was also given ondansetron and lorazepam for nausea, to good effect. She went directly to the cath lab and a Xience stent was placed in the RCA. She bled from her groin afterward. Echocardiogram revealed a LVEF of ___ and findings suggestive of ___ (versus myocarditis). She did not tolerate atorvastatin (myalgia) and was started on pravastatin. She developed a hematoma post-cath with stable hematocrit. Knee pain was treated with oxycodone 10 mg TID. Nausea was further investigated. She described her discomfort as ""stomach spasms"" and not real pain. GI was later consulted, and she underwent EGD. The EGD showed diffuse mild esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis. She was started on pantoprazole 40mg bid. On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery. She recently had a fevers when she had diverticulitis. She denies cough, dysuria, diarrhea. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations. The patient will sometimes have presyncopal episodes related to low blood pressure. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> 1. S/p bilateral knee replacement ___ 2. Depression 3.

Given that this was the presentation of your recent cardiac event, we took this seriously and you were admitted to Cardiology. While you were here we investigated your cardiac function and found it to be improved. This suggests that your cardiac event in ___ was ___ Cardiomyopathy. This means that your heart muscle was stunned by stress hormones. This disorder has an excellent prognosis, with cardiac function typically recovering over a four to six week period. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STOP TAKING WELLBUTRIN (BUPROPRION - from at least a theoretical perspective, this medication may agrevate the neurotransmitter excess that led to ___. This, however, does not most likely explain your nausea and vomiting. For your nausea we considered coeliac disease, which you do not have, helicobacter pylori reflux disease, for which tests were also negative. You bled a little, most likely from your esophagus, while vomting, but this stopped quickly. This can sometimes occur with vigorous vomiting. Recent endoscopy showed that you have some inflammation of the lining of your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Therefore we changed your aspirin to the enteric coated version, as this may contribute to gastritis. In addition, it would be advisable to take spicy food and alcohol only in small amounts. We feel that anxiety may have played some role in your nausea and vomiting, but feel that follow up with Gastroenterology is also warranted. We took an x-ray of your knees and found that they are healing well. Please take your medications as outlined below. Please attend all follow-up appointments as list below. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight > 3 lbs. Adhere to 2 gm of sodium per day diet. This will help you not retain extra fluid while your heart is recovering. Fluid Restriction: Please restrict fluids to thirst - do not drink large volumes of fluid. ","Impression Mrs. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with diverticulitis and coronary artery disease presenting with nausea and vomiting that replicates both of her recent presentations, one for diverticulitis and the other with myocardial infarction. Acute Heart Failure On the basis of rapidly recovered myocardial function on echo, we now think that this may have actually been ___ cardiomyopathy at her last presentation. This fits with her EKG changes, moderate cardiac enzymes and emotional or psychiatric context. Her brother had passed away just a couple of weeks earlier, about which she felt guilty, and she presented to the hospital with this acute cardiac event on her birthday. ___ has a favorable prognosis with good recovery over four to six weeks. It is interesting to consider her tandem use of buproprion with an SSRI. We speculate that this may have contributed to her development of ___ cardiomyopathy, and stopped buproprion after consulting psychiatry. Normetanephrins were elevated, not to pheochromocytoma ranges, and likely due to psychotropics. This diagnosis might also explain why her coronary pathology did not correlate well with EKG changes or territories of reduced contractility. The coronary artery stenosis and possibly her colonic diverticula may have been incidental findings. Nausea and Vomiting Work-up for myocardial infarction was negative. This may have been related to gastritis or erosions from aspirin (we changed to enteric-coated and to ranitidine given Plavix). Gliadin and H. pylori tests were negative. However, her nausea largely resolved, particularly after increasing her anxiolytic medication, Ativan. She also seemed comforted by seeing psychiatry as an inpatient, with whom she will follow-up as an outpatient. There has been no recent vomiting. We now think, given the absence of any positive workup, that this may be exacerbated by anxiety. This also fits with her diagnosis of ___ cardiomyopathy. Nonetheless, she will follow-up with gastroenterology, possibly for gastric emptying studies as suggested in their last note. See also hematemesis below. Hypotensive episode Likely due to hypovolemia (tachycardia with postural drop today) along with vagal activation as affective response. Resolved with fluids and increased oral intake. Depression and anxiety Initially continued high-dose duloxetine and buproprion, given that the patient has been stable on these doses for some time. However, reviewed, as above, with diagnosis of ___. Anxiety and inappropriate affect continued throughout the admission. These medications, in the context of aspirin and Plavix further reduce platelet function. Bruising Aspirin + Plavix + SSRIs --> platelet dysfunction (SSRIs by blocking transport of 5-HT into platelets, which otherwise acts as clotting co-factor). This is the likely reason for increased bruising and decreased threshold for hematemesis when vomiting. Hematemesis See comments above. Resolved spontaneously. UGIB RR with aspirin/Plavix elevated by SSRIs (about 5 to 13 RR). Knee pain Concern for osteo given recovery after surgery and pain appearing about three weeks after implant. X-rays clear - no signs osteomyelitis. Physical exam not consistent with infection. Continued home analgesia and encouraged to continue with ___ Low-Grade Fever Resolved without identification of cause. Constipation Resolved with bowel regimen. Contribution by opioids for knee pain. Tobacco Use Mrs. ___ was counseled numerous times and offered adjuvants for cessation. ",3471,744,12

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr ___, You were admitted with transient symptoms of right arm numbness and right face numbness that were concerning for transient ischemic attack. We attempted an MRI which you did not tolerate and refused. Because it would be unlikely to see an infarct with your short duration of symptoms, we opted to get ultrasound imaging of your brain vessels which showed some stenosis of the right artery in your neck but there was not left sided stenosis. This will need to be followed by another ultrasound in ___ year. The vessels in your brain appeared to be open by ultrasound. Echocardiogram showed some consequences of high blood pressure but no clot in your heart or connection between two chambers. There was a leaky valve that should be followed by your cardiologist. You also had an EEG or brain wave study to assess for possible increased risk of seizure that did not preliminarily show seizures. The final read for this will need to be followed as an outpatient. Regarding your risk factors for stroke, your diabetes risk factor labs were within normal limits, your cholesterol was high and your thyroid function tests showed that you have subclinical hypothyroidism. You should get repeat thyroid function tests in around 1 month. You were ordered for ___ monitor to evaluate for an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that puts you at increased risk for strokes. If you have this arrhythmia, that would be an indication to treat you with a stronger blood thinner. This will be followed by Dr ___. Therefore your medications were changed: Started Fenofibrate 48mg daily Tried Atorvastatin but you reported myalgias in the past. You would benefit from being on a cholesterol lowering medication - Your primary care provider or cardiologist can consider starting simvastatin as an outpatient. Please follow up with Neurology as below. ","___ M w/ hx CAD s/p PCIx3, renal cell carcinoma w/ bony mets s/p nephrectomy/XRT in remission, prior TIA 3 mos ago, presenting with symptoms of right arm followed by upper right eyelid, nasal numbness and dysarthria, resolved after 30 minutes. This is a similar presentation from 3 months ago but slightly prolonged. He was admitted for a TIA/stroke workup given his vascular risk factors and his recent TIA - to evaluate for possible stroke and eval for possible progression of his arterial disease. . Originally, an MRI Brain and MRA head and neck were planned to evaluate for possible ischemia and atherosclerotic disease. However, when the patient was sent down, he refused the MRI and any further attempts. Since his symptoms only lasted 30 minutes, we felt that it was unlikely that he had suffered a stroke. He therefore underwent carotid ultrasound and TCD's to evaluate for severe stenosis of his carotids and large intracranial vessels respectively. His carotid ultrasound showed R ICA 60-69% stenosis and <40% stenosis on the L ICA. He will need a f/u carotid US in ___ year. Transcranial dopplers were negative for intracranial artery stenosis. . Regarding his other risk factors, his fasting lipid panel showed Chol 187, LDL 100, ___ 234. We tried to start atorvastatin for his hypercholesterolemia but he refused to try any statin due to history of myalgias with atorvastatin. This will need to be discussed as an outpatient as it is our formal recommendation that he be initiated on a statin. He was started on fenofibrate for hypertriglyceridemia. HBA1c 5.9%. His thyroid studies did reveal subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 6.7 and free T4 within normal limits. He will need to get follow up TFTs in 1 month. . He was continued on aspirin and Plavix on discharge. . Trans-thoracic echo w/ bubble study showed no source of intracardiac clot, PFO or ASD. He had a mildly dilated aortic root with aortic regurgitation that will be followed by his cardiologist. . He was sent home with ___ of hearts monitor for 2 weeks to evaluate for atrial fibrillation as an additional risk factor. . Given the slow evolution of symptoms, the possibility of ictal etiology was considered though acknowledged to be low. He underwent extended routine EEG that was negative for epileptiform activity but did show generalized slowing and left focal temporal slowly. We thought this may be related to his prior infarct in the left basal ganglia. . . ================================ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ================================ - Follow up Carotid US in ___ year - Repeat thyroid function tests in 1 month. Subclinical hypothyroidism. - ___ of hearts monitor for 2 weeks. - Attempted to restart atorvastatin 20mg but patient refused due to myalgias in the past - this will need to addressed by cardiology as an outpatient - Started on fenofibrate for hypertriglyceridemia - Follow up with outpatient neurology . .

You were found to have a heart attack. You have plaques in your heart's arteries that may need to have stents in the future. You were not able to have a bypass surgery due to the risk. You had a temporary aortic balloon pump to help your heart. You also developed kidney failure. You have a mass on your kidney, that will need to have another imaging study in the future and may need to be removed once your kidney function improves. If the urologist decides to operate on your kidney, you will need to have another procedure to stent the artery in your heart before that happens. You are being discharged to rehab. Please take your medications as instructed. Weigh yourself every day. Call you doctor if the weight increases by more than 3 pounds or if you develop trouble breathing. If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, groin pain, or other concernig symptoms please seek medical attention. ","Mr ___ is an ___ man with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, presenting with syncope and found to have STEMI. . # Sycope: The cause of his sycope on presentation was thought to be most likely orthostatic hypotension with cerebral hypoperfusion given his cerebrovascular disease. Carotid ultrasound showed 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. He had no further syncopal episodes while in house. . # STEMI: Patient initially had positive enyzmes and ST elevations v2-v6. He was given ASA, Plavix, Beta blocker, heparin gtt. He was prehydrated for catheterization. . On ___, repeat EKG showed STE in lateral leads. Enzymes were trended and flat. Pt did not have symptoms. Decision was made to send pt to cardiac cath on ___, demonstrating severe 3 vessel disease. At that point, cardiac surg was consulted for CABG. However, during the morning of ___, pt complained of back pain and STE returned in his lateral leads. Patient was sent again to the cath lab for balloon pump and then transfer to the CCU. . In the ccu, the decision was made not to pursue CABG given multiple medical comorbidities. The patient remained free of chest pain. Medical management including clopidogrel, full dose aspirin, beta blocker, and high dose statin were undertaken. He was weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and it was removed. He had a femoral bruit, so US was done which showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm. . Regarding his coronary disease, the plan was to wait until renal failure resolved and then consider repeat catheterization for revascularization of his LAD. He would need to have this done before any urologic procedure (as below). . # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine on admission was near baseline of 2. After catheterizations, creatinine rose to a high of 5.4. The most likely cause was contrast-induced ATN. He was hydrated, and renal function improved slowly. Creatinine on discharge was 3.2. . # GI bleed: In the CCU, the patient had guaiac positive stools and reported a history of melena. He was given pRBC to maintain Hct >28. GI did an upper endoscopy that showeed erosive gastritis and duodenitis, likely the source of bleeding. He was given BID PPI. Per GI, this would not preclude heparinization for cardiac procedure if needed. . # Renal mass: On non-contrast abdominal CT, patient was found to have a 4 cm L renal mass that was confirmed by ultrasound to be solid. The urology team evaluated the patient and recommended outpatient follow-up for MR with gadolinium after renal function improves. After speaking with his nephrologist (Dr. ___ at ___, he should NOT get MR with gadolinium at any point but should instead have a contrast CT after kidney function improves. He could potentially undergo resection, after LAD is revascularized, if the disease is localized. . # Mild Chronic Systolic heart Failure: Echo from outside hospital showed overall mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but with focal wall motion abnormality. He was on lasix as an outpatient which was held because of acute renal failure. On discharge, he will need to have daily weights and reinstitution of diuretics as needed. . # Hypertension: The patient had a history of chronic hypertension, likely exacerbated by not taking his clonidine the morning of admission. He initially received a nitro drip, transitioning to hydralazine and later to home medications including beta blocker, amlodipine, and clonidine (changed from tablet to patch). Lisinopril was held for renal failure. He was normotensive on this regimen. . # Left orbital edema: The patient had left orbital edema on admission. Head CT at ___ negative for fracture, no point tenderness on exam. The edema resolved within days. . # Leukocytosis: The patient briefly developed leukocytosis. CXR showed a possible L lower lobe infiltrate. He was afebrile and asymptomatic, and the leukocytosis resolved within days. The most likely cause was aspiration pneumonitis. He should be observed while eating until his mental status improves to baseline. . # Hypernatremia: Sodium the day of discharge was slightly elevated at 148. This will need to be followed at the rehab facility. ",3265,973,12

Patient initially presented on ___ with chest pain. She reported that she developed increasing episodes of chest discomfort with walking in the ___ weeks prior to presenation. On the night prior to presentation, she developed chest discomfort at 9pm. She felt this to be GERD and so went to sleep, but woke up all night with chest pain. She described the pain as radiating to her right shoulder and right arm (but not left arm). She took some out of date nitro she had available w/o improvement. The following morning she attempted to get a new nitro prescription at the pharmacy which rapidly helped her pain improve, but it quickly returned and was never completely pain free. She presented to the ED approximately 12 hours after the onset of her pain the night before. . In the OSH ED she was reported to have ST elevation in V2 2mm and ST elevation in V1/V3.

Rest thallium ___: IMPRESSION: Severe fixed perfusion defects in the distal anterior, and apical walls and a moderate defect of the septum, with no evidence of redistribution on the 4 and 24 hr scans to suggest an area of hibernating myocardium. . ECHO ___: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function is depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to extensive severe apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis. The anterior septum and anterior free wall are severely hypokinetic/akinetic. The rest of the left ventricle is hyperdynamic. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. However, due to extensive acoustic artifact from the right heart wire/catheter, the amount of tricuspid regurgitation may be inaccurately quantitated by color-flow imaging. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of ___, extensive left ventricular contractile dysfunction now present. A wire/catheter is seen crossing the tricuspid valve, and there is now significant tricuspid regurgitation, possibly related to the wire/catheter. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> CURRENT MEDICATIONS: (Medications on initial presentation) Aspirin 325 Plavix 75 Lipitor 40 Reportedly non-compliant with meds in the past, but taking aspirin/plavix. .

You have recovered well but an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35% (normal is 55%) and a large area of your heart that is not functioning well. You will need another echocardiogram in about a month to look at the heart function again. You will need to be on coumadin for now to prevent blood clots that could lead to a stroke. Coumadin interferes with the production of Vitamin K in your liver. You will need to check a coumadin level (INR) frequently at first, the desired level is 2.0-3.0. It takes about 3 days for coumadin to work so once your dose is changed, you will need to check your INR in about 3 days. Because your heart is weak, you could start to retain fluid. Please note any increasing shortness of breath, swelliing in your legs, nausea, cough or inability to lie flat to sleep. If you notice these symptoms, call Dr. ___. Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. ___ weight > 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days. Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet and a low fat diet.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. ___ is primary language <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING BELOW OR ABOVE KNEE AMPUTATION . This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency. . ACTIVITY: . There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing until cleared by your Surgeon. You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever possible. . You may use the other leg to assist in transferring and pivots. But try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site when transferring and or pivoting. Please keep knee immobilizer on at all times to help keep the amputation site straight. . No driving until cleared by your Surgeon. . PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS: . Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s) . . Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR. . Exercise: . Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. . Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon. . Try to keep leg elevated when able. . BATHING/SHOWERING: . You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A dressing may cover youre amputation site and this should be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment. . WOUND CARE: . Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for staple removal. . When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower. . Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery. . MEDICATIONS: . Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary. . Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small balanced meals throughout the day. . CAUTIONS: . NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking cessation. . Avoid pressure to your amputation site. . No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery. . DIET : . There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred. . For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred or get a referral from your doctor. . If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight management program. Your health and its improvement depend on it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get a referral from your doctor. . If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor. . FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: . Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated! . Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge. Normal office hours are ___ through ___. . PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

During this procedure it was found that there was a higher than normal pressure within the vessels of your lungs. This indicates fluid excess. During your admission we gently removed much of this excess volume. It is important that you maintain a low salt diet (maximum 2 g sodium per day) and drink to thirst, but not more. We are happy to note that you are weighed daily and this information is followed by your physician. It is particularly important to call your physician if your weight changes by around three pounds. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CONTINUE TO ABSTAIN FROM SMOKING, as this will worsen your heart disease and increases your risk of cancer. During this admission, your medications have changed. Please take all medications as directed below. It is especially important that you take your aspirin daily. This will markedly reduce the chance of your new stent clotting. Please ___ with the physicians listed below. This will be very important in maintaining your health. If you experience increased shortness of breath during activity, increasing weight, ankle or low back swelling, shortness of breath on lying flat or during the night, the control of your heart failure may be worsening. If these symptoms are mild, you should contact your physician ___. If you experience any of the above symptoms are troublesome, or if you experience chest pain, fever, lightheadedness, fatigue, sensations of your heart racing, or any other concerning symptom, you should return to the hospital. Thank you for staying with us at ___, it was a great pleasure to look after you. Information for your physician: 1. LVEF was assessed during the visit with echocardiography and was found to be ___ %. 2. Lisinopril is to be continued after discharge, in keeping with recommendations for ACEI use in patients with heart failure. 3. A beta blocker is also to be continued. 4. Mrs. ___ was counseling regarding smoking cessation and additional help was suggested including nicotine patch. 5. Counseling given regarding: a) Diet and fluid restriction b) Activity level c) Medications d) Weight monitoring e) Heart Failure symptoms f) ___ MD ___ plan 6. Please check electrolytes given adjustment of loop diuretic. ","Patient is a ___ yo woman with severe CAD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and h/o CABG+bioprosthetic AVR+aortic aneurysm repair with ? post-operative neurological event resulting in dysarthria and bilateral carotid endartectomies with symptoms of exertional dyspnea and pedal edema with a recent positive stress test. Elective cardiac catheterization today showed a patent LIMA-LAD and patent LMCA stent but a new severe mid circumflex lesion that was treated with a bare metal stent (along with balloon angioplasty of the proximal circumflex). She was also found to have severely elevated filling pressures with PCW 34 and severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PASP 74), in the setting of LVEF ___ in ___ (decreased compared to a year ago) and a recent syncopal event for which her ACE-inhibitor and diuretics were stopped. # Coronary artery disease. Her mid circumflex lesion was treated with a bare metal stent (given history of prior GI bleeding on clopidogrel). She was treated with ASA, clopidogrel, beta-blocker and high dose statin. She was noted to have a right femoral bruit post-procedure, but femoral ultrasound showed no arterial pathology, suggesting a bruit from chronic peripheral arterial disease. # Acute on chronic left ventricular systolic and diastolic heart failure with LVEF ___ recently (but ___ on echocardiogram this admission). She was diuresed (limited by asymptomatic hypotension to SBP 70-80 mm Hg twice, so placed on furosemide infusion for the ___ triggered episode; treated with further dose reduction in her diuretics and beta-blocker for the ___ triggered episode) and put on an long-acting beta-blocker for heart failure as well as an ACE-inhibitor at low doses (as blood pressure would permit). She received heart failure teaching. Her beta-blocker was changed from carvedilol to metoprolol in hopes of lessening the hypotension, allowing more diuresis and afterload reduction with ACE-inhibition, and to avoid using minute fractions of a pill at each dosing interval (for carvedilol 1.562 mg BID). # Ventricular arrhythmia. Telemetry showed a 24 beat run of ventricular tachycardia. The patient notes that about 2 months ago, she was walking into the bathroom and suddenly blacked out. She does not recall any lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, SOB, chest pain, nausea or sweating prior to passing out. She did not hit her head. She thinks she was out for a minute or two and felt fine upon awakening. She called her husband to pick her up and continued about her day. Given this history of syncope, documented ventricular tachycardia (although in the post-PCI settting) and LV systolic heart failure, an electrophysiology consultation was obtained. Re-evaluation on an outpatient basis by her primary cardiologist for ICD was recommended. # Diabetes mellitus. Treated with insulin sliding scale, ACE-inhibitor. # Hypertension. Restarted beta-blocker, with addition of daily furosemide and ACE-inhibitor. # Leukocytosis. WBC to 13.5 on post-procedure day one. No evidence of infection. This leukocystosis was likely secondary to steroids given for contrast allergy pre-medications. # Dyslipidemia. High dose atorvastatin continued. # GERD. Her PPI was discontinued in favor of a H2 blocker to avoid negative interactions with the activation of clopidogrel. # Tobacco abuse. The important of smoking cessation was discussed repeatedly with the patient, and she was prescribed a nicotine patch. # Dysarthria. Stable during the admission. # Iodinated contrast allergy. Aside from the leukocytosis caused by steroid pre-medications, she had no problems related to use of iodinated contrast. ",3447,844,12

You were brought to this hospital because you were noted to have some EKG changes that were concerning for another heart attack. However, the enzymes which your heart releases after a heart attack were not elevated beyond what we would expect after your procedure last week. We performed a cardiac catheterization, which showed that the stent placed in your graft did not have any clot or blockage. As we discussed, have your primary care doctor check your CBC count when you meet with him in ___ days. When you leave the hospital: - CHANGE your dose of Aspirin to 325 mg Daily (previously you had been taking 81 mg Daily) - START Labetalol 100 mg twice a day - START Lisinopril 10 mg Daily (previously you had been taking 5 mg) - STOP taking Nadolol 40 mg Daily ","Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of OSA on CPAP, dyslipidemia, former tobacco use, PAF, and known CAD s/p CABG x2 in ___ @ ___ (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA), with recent cath and stenting to the SVG-PDA on ___ who presents with chest pain. # CORONARIES: The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain which was not typical of his anginal chest pain after having lunch with his friends. His EKG as described in HPI was concerning for ST-T abnormalities in V3-V4, small inferior q waves, and TWI in III, avF. Given that the patient's pain had not fully resolved upon his admission to the ED, and given that his tropinin was elevated at 0.51 (subsequently trending down to 0.4), he underwent cardiac catheterization, which did not show any stent thrombosis in the SVG-PDA. Additionally, the pateint's CK-MB and CK were not elevated during his admission. The patient did not have any reoccurred of his chest pain post catheterization, and was continued on his home regimen of ASA, Plavix, and ROSUVASTATIN 40 mg ___. On the day of discharge, his EKG was repeated, and the ST abnormalities seen before were lessened in their size, although had not disappeared entirely. On discharge, his Nadolol was discontinued, and replaced Labetalol 100 mg BID. In addition, ___ was instructed to start taking a full dose of aspirin, as opposed to a baby dose. He was also instructed to start taking Lisinopril 10 mg daily, as his physician had previously prescribed. # ANEMIA: HCT on discharge was slightly at 34 than baseline of 38. This could represent a drop secondary to procedure, and the patient does not endorse vomiting blood or having any bowel movements with blood. Nevertheless given his history of bleeding post-cath last time, it will be important to monitor his cath site on the L to see if there is any evidence of hematoma formation. He was instructed to follow-up with his PCP to have ___ repeat HCT check. ",2801,463,12

You underwent an extensive workup for coronary artery disease including lab tests and an exercise stress test that did not reveal disease. We monitored you in the hospital overnight without concerning observing concerning events. We feel confident in discharging you home. Please follow up with your primary care provider ___ 2 weeks to further explore your chest pressure and your episode of loss of consciousness. Thank you for allow us to be a part of your care. Sincerely, Your ___ Cardiology Care Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old with HTN, asthma, history of PMR, and a syncopal episode one week ago who presents for atypical chest pressure and risk factors for CAD with a negative ischemic workup but concerning run of VT during stress test. ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== #Chest pressure: His chest pressure was atypical given that it is not worsened with exertion and no associated symptoms nor radiation. The association of the chest pressure with emotional/psychological stress and relief with relaxation methods suggests anxiety. TTE at ___ showed normal EF and normal LV function early ___. Risk factors for CAD include hypertension and family history. Negative trops x 3. An ECHO stress test revealed no EKG changes concerning for ischemia or hypo/dyskinesis on ECHO. He did have a short run (4 beat) of VT with no other events. He was admitted for observation overnight. Other risk factors for CAD were explored, including diabetes and hyperlipidemia but A1c is 5% but lipids were Tchol 225/ HDL 65/ LDL 141/ ___ 95. Atorvastatin 80mg qd and ASA 81mg qd were started. Due to a relatively negative ischemic workup he was observed overnight without event on telemetry and discharge the next day. #Syncope: Occurred one week ago with no preceding symptoms and associated with chest pressure. No postictal state or abnormal blood glucose. Family history of arrhythmias (AFib) but none observed on telemetry. Orthostatic vital signs negative. Chest pressure episodes started before (2wks ago) syncope and have happened since without syncope. No symptoms or events on telemetry were ever observed during this short admission. Will require further workup in outpatient setting. #Trigeminity: In regards to his trigeminy, these rarely cause severe symptoms and have no known independent prognostic importance. They represent only a repeating pattern of VPBs. Occasionally, patient's may have symptoms from VPBs including palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness. Chest pain and syncope would be atypical presentations for VPBs although syncope could reflect another arrhythmic etiology rather than VPBs and may warrant further evaluation with monitor on discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES: ================ #Hypertension: He continued his home Amlodipine and HCTZ during this admission with adequate control. #Asthma: The patient was diffusely wheezy on admission but did not take Advair on day of presentation. He had a ___ episode of bronchitis treated with steroids x 5 days. He continued his home Advair during this admission with improvement in wheezing. No asthma attacks were observed and he needed no Albuterol rescue. # CODE STATUS: Full confirmed # CONTACT: ___ (wife and HCP) Phone TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - No episodes of syncope or telemetry events during this admission and orthostatic vital signs negative, therefore, further workup in outpatient is recommended. - Consider an event(___) monitor as part of syncope workup.

A bare metal stent was placed in one of the arteries in your heart (called the Left Circumflex Artery) to restore blood flow to your heart muscle. To prevent another blood clot from forming on this stent and causing another heart attack, it is crucially important that you take your aspirin and prasugrel every day for the next ___ days, and then continue taking your aspirin and plavix every day for at least ___ year beyond that. You are being discharged on several medications that will help to protect your heart from further damage and so taking this medicaion regimen as prescribed is important for you. An echocardiogram (imaging of your heart) was performed after your heart attack and showed that some damaged had been done to your heart muscle, but that this was limited thanks to your cardiac intervention and stenting of the clotted vessel. You will need to have close follow up with a cardiologist (see the appointment below), for continued care of your heart. You have also been diagnosed with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, three conditions that are important for the health of your heart and for life span and quality of life moving forward. You have been started on medications for these medical problems and will need close follow up with a primary care physician (see appointment below) to ensure these conditions are appropriately managed.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to distal septum and inferior wall, distal anterior wall, and apex. There is severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments, with the lateral wall relatively less hypokinetic in comparison with other segments (LVEF = 15 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The apex is trabeculated. No apical thrombi are seen, but a small mural thrombus cannot be excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened without aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderately dilated left ventricular cavity. Severely depressed systolic function due to severe wall motion abnormalities indicative of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, as described. Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal free wall systolic function. Mildly dilated aortic root. CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___: COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated severe native three vessel disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had a 60% proximal stenosis with a 70% major diagonal stenosis at the origin, and a 100% occlusion mid-LAD. The LCX had a 40% stenosis in OM1. There was a diffusely diseased ramus. The RCA was known 100% occluded with left ot right collaterals to distal vessel with diffuse disease in the PDA. 2. Selective venous conduit angiography demonstrated new total occlusion of the origin of the previously stented LAD graft. All other grafts were known to be occluded and were not engaged, including the LIMA-LAD. 3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypotension. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. New occlusion of the previously stented SVG-LAD graft. 3. No clear targets for repeat CABG, recommend medical management. CTA CHEST ___: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolus. 2. Thickened interlobular septations and small opacities, likely reflect pulmonary edema. Superimposed infection is possible. The above findings appear progressed since ___ exam. Follow-up CT exam is recommended following treatment for pulmonary edema to exclude superimposed infection. 3.

You were transferred to ___ from an outside hospital because you were having chest pain due to a heart attack. You had a cardiac catheterization on ___ but unfortunately the cardiologist were not able to open up any of the blockages in your heart. This means that your Coronary Artery Disease can only be managed with medicines and risk factor management. You should therefore stop smoking. You were started on a blood thinner called coumadin while you were in the hospital. This medication is being used to thin your blood so that you do not have another stroke given that you have heart failure and a certain part of your heart is not moving as it normally should. You will be discharged to a rehabilitation facility where you can work with physical therapy. You will also require ongoing monitoring of your blood (by measuring INR) to ensure the coumadin is at the right dose. ","REASON FOR ADMISSION: ___ yo male with long-standing, multi-vessel CAD presenting with pleuritic chest pain & troponin elevation; found to have non-intervenable NSTEMI. ACUTE DIAGNOSES: # NSTEMI: The patient was admitted with substernal chest pain and burning for a couple of days prior to admission. His EKG revealed evidence of anterior ischemia and his cardiac biomarkers were positive. He was taken to the cath lab on ___ which revealed an occlusion of the previously stented SVG-LAD graft. There were no clear targets for repeat CABG or PCI. The patient was managed medically on the cardiology floor. His medications were optimized; metoprolol and isosorbide mononitrate were up-titrated. He was started on a high dose statin as well as an ACE-inhibitor. He was chest pain free for many days at the time of discharge. He will continue on plavix, low-dose aspirin, & coumadin (see below) for high-risk CAD. # ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CHF: The patient's post-MI TTE showed an EF 15% with apical akinesis. Given the stroke risk associated with apical akinesis, the paitent was started on a heparin bridge to coumadin. Goal INR ___. He will continue on aspirin, plavix, & coumadin. His heart failure regimen was optimized and he was started on an ACE-inhibitor, spironolactone, and lasix. His I&O balance was relatively even on this dose of lasix; he appears euvolemic on discharge (slighy bibasilar crackles are likely atelectatic). His potassium was stable between 4.7-5.1 at the time of discharge. He should have his potassium rechecked on ___ to ensure it stays below 5.3 on his current medications (otherwise his dose of spironolactone may need to be decreased to 12.5 mg QD). He should be maintained on a 2 gm sodium restricted diet, as well as a 1200 mL fluid restriction. CHRONIC ISSUES: # DM: A1c = 6.1 on admission. Complicated by peripheral neuropathy. He was discharged on his home regimen of metformin & sitagliptin. Continued pregabalin for peripheral neuropathy # HLD: Lipids at goal on admission. The patient was started on atorvastatin 80 mg QD on admission. His LFTs should be checked within 5 weeks to ensure they are normal. His home niacin & fibrate were discontinued. # HTN: Continue metoprolol as above. # DJD: Continue home pain regimen. A prescription for Vicodin was provided for his rehab center. # CKD: Baseline creatinine reportedly 1.3-1.4. Now 1.3 on discharge. His creatinine should be checked on ___ to ensure it continues to be stable on his current regimen of medications. # PVD: Continue aspirin & plavix as above. # COPD: Last PFTs were not suggestive of emphysema. Pt not on any COPD meds. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # LABWORK: The patietn needs the following labwork checked while he is at rehab. - INR should be checked daily for the next couple of days to ensure he remains stably therapeutic on his initiation dose of 5 mg coumadin daily - A basic metabolic metabolic should be checked on ___ to ensure that the patient's creatinine is stable and not uptrending on his new medications. Also, his potassium should be checked to ensure it is less than 5.3. Further labs should be rechecked at the discretion of a physician at rehab. # VOIDING TRIAL: The patient's Foley catheter was discontinued on ___. He will be due to void at roughly 4:30 ___. If he has not passed urine at that time, he should be bladder scanned and evaluated by a physician for possible reinsertion of a Foley catheter. # FOLLOW UP: The patient will need to arrange for a follow up with his cardiologist upon leaving rehab.

Compared to tracing #1 the patient is mostly ventricularly paced at this time. Clinical correlation is suggested. TRACING #2 CXR ___ FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___. Status post sternotomy and bypass surgery, presence of left-sided permanent pacer with three intracavitary electrodes, two of which terminating in right atrial area and the third in right ventricular area. They all appear unchanged. The pulmonary congestive pattern, mild degree of pulmonary vascular distention and prominent vasculature in upper pulmonary compartments (upper zone re-distribution pattern)also appear unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature again appears crowded in the bases, apparently related to the relatively high-positioned diaphragms and poor inspirational effort. There is no evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates or signs of pleural effusion blunting the lateral pleural sinuses as can be identified on a single view chest examination. No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings, no conclusive evidence for increasing pulmonary congestion. Comparison with next previous study obtained on ___. Question of increasing pleural effusion or basal infiltrates could be answered more definitely if a lateral chest view had been obtained. TTE ___ The left atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Well-seated and normally functioning bioprothetic AVR and mitral annuloplasty ring. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, estimated pulmonary artery pressures are able to be measured and are moderately elevated. Cardiac Perfusion ___ RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 10.3 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest ___ 31.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ___ HISTORY: ___ yo man with a history of diabetes, CHF, AVR/MVR, AF s/p ___ and CAD with prior CABG and PCI referred for evaluation of exertional chest pain and dyspnea. SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 milligram/kilogram/min. He had no anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG. IMAGING METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. INTERPRETATION: The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and left arm attenuation. There is a cold spot at the left shoulder consistent with an implanted device. Left ventricular cavity size is normal. Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal septal akinesis with normal thickening, consistent with prior cardiac surgery and/or ventricular pacing. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 67% with an EDV of 103 ml. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. Compared with prior study of ___, the prior defect is no longer present. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Finasteride 5 mg PO DAILY 2.

History is limited due to language barrier (patient primarily ___, even with assistance of telephone interpreter. He was in his usual state of health until 2 days prior to admission when developed constant, waxing-and-waning, nonradiating left-sided substernal chest pressure at rest in association with mild shortness of breath, but no nausea/diaphoresis; other reports indicate that chest pain was exertional. He denies recent fevers/chills/sweats, URI symptoms, cough, PND/orthopnea, peripheral edema, travel/immobilization, or positional component to chest pain. Chest pain is reportedly reminiscent of that which he experienced in the context of NSTEMI. He reports taking all prescribed medications, including clopidogrel, at home, but has not tried SL nitroglycerin. When chest pain persisted, he called EMS, with aspirin 325mg administered en route to the outside hospital. At the outside hospital, EKG and cardiac enzymes were unremarkable, as was CBC. CXR was negative. He received SL nitroglycerin x1 (with decline in SBP from uncertain baseline to 102), as well as enoxaparin 90mcg x1 ___, 2: 12am) prior to transfer to ___ at the patient's request for further management. In the ___ ED, initial vital signs were as follows: 98.4, 80, 102/77, 16, 98% RA. Multiple EKGs were interpreted as negative for acute ischemic EKG changes, and TnT x2 were <0.01. ETT yielded non-anginal type symptoms, no objective evidence of myocardial ischemia, and blunted hemodynamic response in the presence of beta blocker therapy. He received morphine 5mg x1, metoprolol tartrate 50mg x1, aspirin 325mg, and simvastatin 40mg. He was evaluated by the cardiology fellow, who advised admission to the cardiology service, given clinical concern for unstable angina, with repeat cardiac catheterization in the morning. Heparin gtt was not initiated in the ED in the absence of troponinemia or dynamic EKG changes and equivocal stress test. Vital signs at transfer were as follows: 97.6, 73, 110/68, 14, 97% RA. On arrival to the floor, he rates chest pain as ___ in intensity and is otherwise comfortable.

Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are compatible with prior CABG. A dual-lead pacer device is noted overlying the left chest wall with lead tips in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle. The lungs appear clear bilaterally and demonstrate no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. There is widening of the AP diameter of the chest which is seen with flattened diaphragms suggesting underlying emphysema. There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. The aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic calcifications along the knob noted. Bony structures appear intact with degenerative changes in the mid thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Likely underlying COPD. . Head CT (___): FINDINGS: There is no acute intra-axial hemorrhage, major vascular territory infarction, mass effect or edema. There is preservation of the gray-white matter differentiation. Periventricular white matter hypodensity is likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. In addition a more rounded hypodensity in the left basal ganglia (2: 13) may represent a chronic lacunar infarct. Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is consistent with a moderate degree of diffuse parenchymal volume loss. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. No osseous abnormality is identified. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Probable chronic lacunar infarct in the left basal ganglia. 3.

The patient completed 10 minutes of a Gervino protocol representing an average exercise tolerance; ~ ___ METS. The exercise test was stopped due to fatigue. No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the procedure. The ECG is unintepretable for ischemia in the presence of ventricular pacing. The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with occasional isolated VPDs noted in exercise. More frequent VPDs were noted mid- to late post-exercise. The heart rate response to exercise was appropriate. The blood pressure response to exercise was flat. IMPRESSION: Average exercise tolerance. No anginal symptoms with an ECG that is uninterpretable for ischemia in the presence of ventricular pacing. Appropriate heart rate response. Blood pressure response to exercise was flat. Nuclear report sent separately. Nuclear report: Left ventricular cavity is dilated at stress greater than the rest. Resting and stress perfusion images reveal small-sized moderate severity reversible perfusion defect in the basal lateral ventricular wall. dditionally, there is a mild to moderate small fixed apical perfusion defect. There are no studies available for comparison. IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate severity small reversible lateral basal perfusion defect. 2. Mild to moderate small fixed apical perfusion defect. 3. transient left ventricular cavity dilatation, can be seen in multivessel disease. <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> It was a pleasure to be involved in your care, Mr. ___. You were admitted because of chest pain. You underwent an exercise stress test which showed a small reversible perfusion defect in one part of your heart. After talking to your cardiologist Dr. ___ your family, we decided to continue medical management instead of cardiac catheterization. Your medications have changed: Your INR was high, so we discontinued your coumadin while you were hospitalized. Please have your INR re-checked tomorrow, and discuss the result with Dr. ___ when you see him. A new medication, isosorbide mononitrate, was added to control your symptoms. If you develop recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, leg swelling, or any other symptom that concerns you, please call your doctor or come back to the Emergency Department immediately. ","___ c h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia, CAD s/p CABG in ___ and pacemaker placement presented with 2 episodes of chest pain. . # Chest pain: EKG unchanged. Cardiac enzyme neg. The story, however, was confusing as the patient only talked about the chest pain he experienced when he was doing some sweeping (mild exertion) in the parking lot outside his home, but the son reported patient had a second episode of chest pain at rest. The team discussed the options and thought a stress test is likely more reasonable for this patient. We discussed the option with the family including the son ___ who is a virologist and patient's healthy care proxy, and they agree with the plan. Patient was continued on ASA, atenolol, lisinopril and simvastatin. He was monitored on tele with no significant event. Exercise nuclear stress test showed reversible small basal lateral moderate perfusion defect. After discussing with patient's cardiologist Dr. ___ the son, the decision was made to medically manage patient given his comorbidities. Isosorbide mononitrate was added to help with symptom relife. . # Headache: Patient has been complaining of a new headache since admission. Given his INR was supratherapeutic at 4.3 on admission, head CT was ordered, which showed no ICH or SDH. Patient refused pain medication, and his headache improved without intervention. . # s/p pacemaker for slow ventricular response in atrial fibrillation: Patient was monitored on tele, no significant event was noted. Coumadin was held given supratherapeutic INR. Home atenolol was continued.

Q waves in leads III and aVF with deep T wave inversion in the inferior and lateral precordial leads, consistent with an evolving inferior myocardial infarction. Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3 suggestive of a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the diffuse T wave inversions are new, as are the inferior Q waves, consistent with evolution of the previously seen inferior myocardial infarction pattern. ECHO: ___ The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior, posterior, and lateral hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

You were transferred to ___ from the ___ emergency room. While you were in the hospital we sought to determine the cause of this pain by doing both blood work and diagnostic testing. We found that you were not having a heart attack, but because of a history of heart disease and a heart attack in ___, we did a cardiac catheterization to better evaluate the arteries that provide your heart with blood. We found that you have 40% blockage of your ""left main coronary artery"" and slow flow through your other coronary arteries. These findings may explain your chest pain, although other causes such as anxiety, muscle strain, or acid reflux are other possibilities. After discharge from the hospital it will be very important to see a cardiologist regularly along with a primary care physician. We are changing some of your medications, and it will be important to ensure you follow the instructions below on exactly which medicines to take. These medicines will protect your heart, lower your blood pressure and reduce the chance of further blockage of your coronary arteries that supply the heart with blood. This will reduce your chance of a heart attack. It has been a pleasure caring for you during your time at ___. We wish you all the best in your recovery! Kind regards, ___ Cardiology ","___ y/o woman with H/O hypertension and MI in ___, presenting with ___ chest pain radiating to left arm, consistent with wide differential including cardiac (unstable angina/acute coronary syndrome), GI (GERD, esophageal spasm, PUD, pancreatitis) or musculoskeletal pain. # Chest Pain - Idiopathic at this time, likely does not represent ACS given normal EKG, TnT <0.01 twice. However, given atherosclerotic history (MI in ___, 70% left carotid stenosis, along with prior angiography at ___ showing 50% stenosis of LM and 40% stenosis of RCA), she was sent for coronary angiography. On ___, she was found to have 40% left main coronary artery stenosis (with normal pressure wire study) and slow flow consistent with microvascular disease. Other possibilities remain including gastrointestinal (GERD, gastritis), musculoskeletal causes such as costochondritis, anxiety, or idiopathic. There was no rash to suggest herpes zoster. During her hospitalization, telemetry showed no abnormal cardiac rhythms. She had one <10 minute episode of chest pain while in the hospital that resolved without treatment. Her troponins remained <0.01. Her vital signs remained stable throughout her hospital stay. At no time during her episodes of chest pain either before or during her hospitalization did she report any associated symptoms such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, weakness. She was discharged on ___ with a regimen including ASA 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg (raised from home dose of 10 mg given LMCA disease), isosorbide mononitrate ER 60 mg, and metoprolol succinate 25 mg PO daily. She will need outpatient follow up with her cardiologist. # Hypertension: Managed with metoprolol. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Medication changes including raising dose of atorvastatin will require regular monitoring by PCP - ___ need to see both a primary care physician and ___ cardiologist as an outpatient ",2000,440,12

Unfortunately, this stroke has left you with weakness in your right face, arm, and leg. We anticipate that you will regain some function over time. To maximize potential gain in function we have discharged you to rehabilitation. We believe that your stroke occurred because of a possible blockage in one of the vessels that provides blood to the left side of your brain. We want to reduce your risk of having another stroke so therefore have started you on a medication called warfarin which acts to thin your blood. You will be discharged with a monitor to ensure that there is no abnormal rhythm in your heart leading to increased stroke risk and we will schedule you for an appointment with one of our stroke physicians. Please immediately come to the hospital next time you have sudden onset of weakness or other symptoms. Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to ___ with stroke and infection. WHAT HAPPENED: - You were admitted to the neurology service given that you had weakness on your right side. Imaging found that you had a stroke. - You have narrowing of one of the blood vessels in the neck and brain. We think this is what caused the stroke. You are on a medication to prevent further narrowing of those blood vessels. - You also have narrowing of the blood vessel in the right leg preventing good blood flow to your feet causing the ulcer and pain. - We think the narrowing of these blood vessels is due to atherosclerosis from abnormal cholesterol. - Additionally, you were treated for a fever with antibiotics. When the antibiotics were stopped, your fevers went away - You had other testing to looking for causes of your stroke, these tests were normal IMPORTANT MEDICATIONS - You are on a new anti-clotting drug. You should stop your plavix until you are told to restart this medication by your neurologist - Continue to take your medications for lupus as you were at home. No changes were made to these medications. - Continue to take your atorvastatin 80 mg daily - Start warfarin 2mg daily. This medication causing easy bleeding. This medication needs to be monitored by frequent lab draws to measure INR (goal ___. You will take this medication for one month last day ___. Discuss with your neurologist before stopped. You should restart your plavix at this time. ****Warfarin causes easy bleeding. If you notice gum bleeding, nose bleeding, easy bruising call your doctor. If you start or stop any medications most importantly antibiotics call your doctor, these medications will effect your warfarin level*****If you notice blood in your stool, fall, hit/bump your head report to the emergency department****** - We started a new medication called Cilostazol 50 mg once in the morning and once in the evening. This will help the pain in your legs. During this hospitalization, you were diagnosed with a TIA or Stroke. You received materials and information about strokes and TIAs. This includes information on: understanding what a stroke is, warning signs of another stroke, calling 911 if warning signs occur, risk factors for stroke, and care options that may be available after you leave the hospital.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having a heart attack. You had a catheterization of your heart, and you were found to have a blockage in your left anterior descending artery that was cleared and a bare metal stent was placed. You will need to take plavix and aspirin every day for at least one month and likely for much longer. Do not miss any doses or stop taking Plavix unless Dr. ___ you that it is OK. You should continue to take your other medicines as noted below. Please follow physical therapy instructions for activity for the next few weeks. . We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. STOP taking Ibuprofen, take tylenol as needed for pain instead 2. Increase aspirin to 325 mg daily 3. START taking clopidogrel (Plavix) to keep the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack. Only Dr. ___ will tell you when it is OK to stop this medicine 4. START taking metoprolol twice daily to help your heart recover from the heart attack. 5. Continue Crestor at 5 mg daily to lower your cholesterol. Please try to take every day if you can. 6. STOP taking niacin per Dr. ___ ___ Instructions: ___","___ year-old male with a past medical history of NSTEMI in ___ s/p POBA to the culprit occluded ramus and DES to the LAD, hyperlipidemia, depression presenting with acute onset chest pain this morning, symptoms indicative of unstable angina, new RBBB, J point elevations on ECG, now s/p BMS to mid LAD lesion. . ACTIVE DIAGNOES: . # NSTEMI S/P BMS to LAD: Pt presented same day with acute severe anginal chest pain, ECG showed NSR, new RBBB, right asix deviation, ___epressions V2/V3 with a deep S wave in V4/V5, 1-2 mm STE in v3/v4. Code STEMI was called, patient started on ASA 325mg, heparin drip, loading dose of Plavix, started on an integrillin drip, and taken to the cath lab. Cath showed aneurysm formation within the DES to the LAD, with stents widely patent except for a 70-80% stenosis in the mid LAD. This lesion was ballooned and a BMS (Integrity) placed to mid LAD. His pain rapidly improved and follow-up EKG's showed resolution of his RBBB and normal sinus rhythm. TTE showed LVEF of 60% but the midventricular segment of the anterior and lateral walls appear hypokinetic. He was discharged on 325 aspirin daily, 75mg plavix, 25 metoprolol tartrate BID, and re-started on his prior home crestor with follow-up arranged with his outpt PCP and cardiologist. He was instructed to to stop his niacin and ibuprofen. . CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: . # HLD: Stable. Total Chol 135, Trigs 150, HDL 38, LDL 79. He was re-started on his home crestor 5mg PO 3 days weekly. He did not previously tolerate atorvaststain (developed weakness and abdominal pain) and has had trouble with other statins previously. . # Depression: Stable. Continued on his home citalopram. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: . 1)Pt has new BMS to mid LAD, on plavix and ASA 325mg. Follow-up set up with his home cardiologist who will manage his cardiac meds. 2)Pt has history of poor medication compliance especially with statin drugs. His LDL was 79 here, would likely benefit from aggressive lowering to <70. He is on the largest dose of crestor that we think he will presently tolerate. Would attempt to uptitrate as an outpatient.

He called his cardiologist on the day of admission, who referred him to the emergency room for further evaluation. He continued to have symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath which improved with morphine and ativan. He denies missing any doses of aspirin or Plavix. . He describes the symptoms as tightness in his chest, but the symptoms are similar to past episodes of GERD (but which have not occurred in recent years). The tightness was generally present all day, waxing and waning, with no clear precipitants. It was not related to exertion, rest, or food intake. His shortness of breath was more ""shallow breathing"" which was just ""a little bit off from usual"". The tightness did not radiate, and he denied nausea, diaphoresis, vomiting, and palpitations. He did not take any SL nitro for these symptoms. On ___ night, he took a few extra Rolaids (on top of his ranitidine) and slept through the night without further symptoms, but once he awoke on ___, the symptoms recurred. He reports a sour taste in the back of his throat. . In the ED, his triage vitals were 96.9F, BP 198/91, HR 60, RR 14, Sat 98%RA. EKG was reportedly unchanged, and a CXR was normal. His vital signs were all stable. His first set of cardiac enzymes was negative. He was chest pain free at the time of transfer to the floor. . On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> #) CAD #) GERD, on ranitidine #) Hypertension, on valsartan and atenolol #) Hyperlipidemia, on atorvastatin and ezetimibe; last lipid profile ___ with LDL 100, HDL 69 #) GI parasite: loose stool since ___.

You had blood tests that showed no evidence of a heart attack. You had a stress test which was deemed to be similar to your previous stress tests in the past. Your symptoms were probably due to heartburn. . We started you on a higher dose of an acid-reducing medication (Protonix, pantoprazole) to help control the heartburn. Please follow up with your primary care physician for further evaluation of the heartburn. We also increased your Valsartan to 160 mg by mouth daily to treat your elevated blood pressure. . Please take your other medications as directed and keep your followup appointments. .

Chest discomfort: His symptoms are most likely GERD associated. There may have been an irritative component from the stent placement to the RCA that was transmitted to the diaphram. There was concern for cardiac etiology of his chest discomfort (ie ACS) given his recent catherization 4 days ago -- however, it was deemed unlikely to be instent restenosis (EKG without ST elevations, cardiac enzymes negative x3.) Because he has known CAD with multiple stents and some components of his symptoms were similar to his anginal equivalent, a nuclear stress test was ordered. It showed a fixed inferior defect similar to one seen in a previous stress test from ___. He was chest pain free throughout his admission, except during exertion from his stress test. Because of the negative enzymes, the unchanged EKG, the similarity of the two stress tests, the decision was made not to re-catheterize. He was continue on his home doses of aspirin, plavix, statin, Beta Blocker, and ACEI was increased. He was also restarted on protonix 40 PO BID, and maalox as needed. . #. Pump: euvolemic. continued Beta Blocker, ACE Inhibitor. . #. Rhythm: normal sinus rhythm. continued telemetry. . #.

He reports this morning while helping his wife fold laundry he developed sharp, sub-sternal chest pain that radiated to his right arm and elbow. He notes that his wife gave him an 81mg ASA to take for this pain. Given persistent pain for approximately one hour, this prompted him to present to BI-N. He notes that his pain resolved spontaneously as he was traveling to the hospital. He denies ever having pain like this. He reports no exertional chest pains, but does note some exertional dyspnea with heavy activity recently, but he is unsure if this is just from being out of shape. Initially at OSH, trop was negative. Plan was for second set and stress, but second trop returned positive at 0.03 and given his story and concerning cardiac history, he was transferred for further evaluation. At ___- troponin noted to be negative initially then 0.042. EKG there noted NSR 98 bpm without STE/STD.

She has had some episodes of syncope in the past but these were always in circumstances of high ambient temperatures and poor fluid intake rather than sudden losses of concsiousnes and thus are likely secondary to dehydration and/or vagal reactions rather than tachycardia epsiodes. No further workup was deemed neccessary for these findings at this point. Continued follow up with her cardiologist was recommended at discharge. . # HTN - Mrs. ___ blood pressures were well controlled throught her hospital stay. Her home amlodipine and atenolol were continued. Inlight of diabetes and in the presence of frequent ankle edema and possible diastolic heart failure switching amlodipine to an ACE-I and possibly addition of a duretic may be considered in the out-patient setting. . # CAD - As discussed above Mrs. ___ current presentation does not seem to be related to her coronary artery disease. Medication for control of her CAD including atenolol and simvastatin were continued during this admission. Of note although Aspirin is indicated for secondary prevention Mrs. ___ refuses to take it due to associated gastric bloating in the past. ",2765,749,12

You were admitted with chest pain, but according to diagnostic tests, were not found to be having a heart attack. You underwent a ""nuclear scan"" which showed that there is an area of that sometimes does not get enough blood, which is what is likely causing your symptoms. However, given what was found during your last catherization, it is unlikely that a repeat catherization will be able to fix this. You were discharged home in a stable condition. NEW OR CHANGED MEDICATIONS: Your imdur was increased from 120mg daily to 120mg in the morning and 60mg in the evening. You have also been given a prescription for Ranexa 500mg twice daily. This medication is to help you with your chest pain. You should discuss this new regimen with Dr. ___ cardiologist when you see her on ___. Of note, one incidental finding that was found on the CT scan that you received was a small aneurysm at the branch of your iliac arteries.

He was found in triage to have a heart rate in the 180's accompanied by SOB and dizziness. By the time he was moved back to a room in the ED, his heart rate had decreased to the 80's. He reported that he began to have multiple episodes of palpitations this morning. He had dizziness that started in his chest and progressed superiorly to his head. He also endorsed shortness of breath but no syncope. He also endorses fevers to 100.3 in the afternoons since his recent lap chole. He is followed by Dr. ___ as ___ for paroxysmal Afib and he was initially diagnosed in the setting of heavy alcohol consumption. He now avoids alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco. He continues to have palpitations approximately once per month but his episodes usually last seconds. He was treated with a beta blocker in ___ but this was discontinued due to his lack of symptoms. He was restarted on his beta blocker after his NSTEMI earlier this year, but this was discontinued due to hypotension. In the ED, he had a CTA chest negative for PE, and a RLE ultrasound negative for DVT (on ED eval, there was some concern for RLE swelling). He was evaluated by surgery who felt there was no acute surgical issue but recommended a RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for biloma.

You were started on a medication called metoprolol to control your heart rate. You were seen by the electrophysiology team who felt that this was not concerning at this time and that metoprolol is the medicaiton of choice to treat your symptoms. You did not have a heart attack. You should follow-up with Dr. ___ as previously scheduled on ___. We have contacted Dr. ___ to let him know what has occurred during this admission. Additionally, as you were several days out from your cholecystectomy, the surgery team followed you during admission. You had an ultrasound of your surgical area which showed normal post-surgical changes. Check your blood pressure at home if you feel lightheaded or dizzy on your new medication. If your pressure is low, you should hold the medication or take a half dose until you see your cardiologist on ___.

","___ year old male with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, CAD s/p PCI with DESx2 to RCA in ___, and recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (on admission, he was post-op day 5) who presented to the ED with SOB and dizziness, found to have tachycardia on evaluation. #. Supraventricular Tachycardia: He has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past and was not on any AV nodal blocking agent on admission. He had multiple episodes of tachycardia during this hospitalization, typically during exercise. He was monitored on telemetry during this episodes. He was seen by the electrophysiology team who felt that his tachycardia was supraventricular tachycardia. It was felt that the most likely rhythms were AVNRT vs. atrial tachycardia. He was started on metoprolol and this was uptitrated to 25mg po twice daily. His heart rate and blood pressure tolerated this medication without issue. After uptitrating this medication, he had no further episodes of SVT. If his episodes recur, he will likely need an EP study. #. Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy: He had a laparoscopic cholecystecomy five days prior to admission. He had been having low grade fevers at home, and had temperatures to 99.5 degrees in the afternoons during hospitalization. He was evaluated by surgery who felt he was recovering well from his recent surgery. He had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was consistent with post-operative changes. He had a negative urinalysis, RLE ultrasound negative for DVT, and he was encouraged to use incentive spirometry. #.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms. ___, You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking, right facial droop, and inability to move your left side resulting possibly from a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA). This occurs when there is decreased blood flow to your brain. TIAs are temporary and resolve. The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. It is worth noting that possible loss of consciousness while seated on the toilet can cause a separate syndrome called vasovagal syncope, and this also remains a possibility. The MRI did not show any evidence of stroke. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: - High lipids in your blood (cholesterol and triglycerides) - High blood pressure We are changing your medications as follows: - We are holding pramipexole due to family concerns, but you could consider resuming half your home dose (0.125mg) in the future. - Reduced Memantine from 7mg to 5mg, a needed adjustment due to current renal function - Held Tramadol as there is a reaction between this medication and Trazadone, please continue to hold until you follow up with your primary care doctor. - Added Trazadone 37.5mg at bedtime to help you sleep. - Added Sulfameth/Trimethoprim DS (Bactrim) 1 tab twice daily for your urinary tract infection. - Added Miconazole powder 2% 1 application three times daily to treat your skin rash. - Added Plavix 75mg daily to help prevent future strokes. - Added Atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime for high cholesterol. Please take your other medications as prescribed. Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician as listed below. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team "," ___ is an ___ y/o F with a PMHx of HTN, ___ dementia, MI, CAD, TIA, rheumatoid arthritis, and PMR who was transferred from ___ for tPA care in the setting of R facial droop, left sided weakness, and aphasia concerning for stroke. She was last known well on ___ at 0900 and her NIHSS score was 9. She was given tPA at 1155. She had a negative NCHCT and was transferred to ___. On arrival, her NIHSS score was 7. Her exam here was notable for improvement in mental status and speech output as well as improved movement of LUE and LLE and with residual R nasolabial fold flattening. Her CTA showed a heavily calcified plaque at the L ICA origin causing lumenal narrowing. Given her elevated white count, likely due to recent pneumonia and/or prednisone taper, she had a CXR and U/A which initially showed no infectious process (see UTI below). She subsequently had an MR brain which showed no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage. Etiology of episode is unknown but thought to likely be anTIA vs. vasovagal syncope. She had a TTE which revealed mild dilation of the left atrium and hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior basal and mid walls without evidence of thrombus. Her EKG and troponin did not reveal concern for acute ischemia. Although an aberrant heart rhythm was not observed during this admission, it cannot be ruled out as the primary etiology. Her cardiovascular risk factors include mild hyperglycemia (A1c 6.6%) and significant hyperlipidemia (LDL 109 and ___ 673). She was started on Atorvastatin 20 mg (not a higher dose due to Zocor allergy), and Plavix was reinitiated. During her admission, she continued to have labile affect, paranoia, and encephalopathy. Due to concerns for a continued reduction in her baseline cognitive function, investigation into reversible causes of delirium were explored. Pramipexole was held initially (per OMR, held due to nightmares; per family, held because they wondered if it could cause paranoia); the initial plan was to restart at half the dose on discharge, but her family declined this. Infection screen revealed a urinary tract infection pan-sensitive enterobacter. She was started on Ceftriaxone and transitioned to Bactrim by discharge (to which the enterobacter was susceptible). Her sleep was very poor while inpatient and disruption of sleep/wake cycle likely contributed to her delirium. Therefore, trazadone was started to help her sleep at night. Her son reported that he observed an episode of bilateral hand/forearm shaking that lasted minutes during this admission. Therefore, an extended routine EEG was performed and then expanded to an overnight continuous EEG to better define anomolies observed. Her son reported that he observed an episode of bilateral hand/forearm shaking that lasted minutes during this admission. Overnight continuous EEG demonstrated generalized slowing and bifrontal and L to R frontal slowing; the latter could be due to subcortical disease. There was no epileptiform activity. By discharge, she was following simple commands intermittently, strength in all extremities were at least antigravity, there was paucity of speech but no dysarthria, she was still not oriented to person/place/time, but her acute confusional state had improved. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES [ ] F/u with PCP ___ ___ weeks after discharge, appointment still needs to be scheduled. [ ] F/u with cardiologist, appointment has been scheduled. [ ] F/u with neurologist, appointment has been scheduled. Call to get on cancellation list for earlier appointment. [ ] Continue prednisone taper. [ ] Pramipexole was held initially.

You were also found to have high blood pressure. During your stay, we closely monitored your heart with numerous ECGs and with lab tests. These tests indicated that you were NOT having a heart attack and that there was no permanent heart damage. In addition, we managed your pain with a medication called nitroglycerine through the IV. This medication also helped us to control your blood pressure. You underwent an exercise test to help see how much you can exercise without chest pain, and this test failed to show active heart damage, although you were not able to exercise intensely and you did have chest discomfort during the test. You also underwent an echocardiogram, or an ultrasound picture of your heart, which showed normal heart function and some expected changes due to your high blood pressure. Finally, you underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no new blockages in your heart arteries as compared to the one you had in ___. All of the stents you have previously had placed are still open. In terms of your cardiac medicines, we changed some and kept others the same. We changed your isosorbide mononitrate (also called Imdur) to a dose of 150 mg every morning and none in the evening. We started a new blood pressure medication called hydralazine at a dose of 20 mg three times per day. We made no changes to your aspirin (still 81 mg every day), clopidogrel (also called Plavix, still at a dose of 75 mg every day), rosuvastatin (also called Crestor, still at a dose of 40 mg every evening), ezetimibe (also called Zetia, still at a dose of 10 mg every evening), fenofibrate (reduced from 160 mg to 145 mg every day), lisinopril (still at a dose of 40 mg every day), amlodipine (still at a dose of 10 mg every day) or spironolactone (still at a dose of 25 mg every day). We also contacted your regular, outpatient Cardiologist, Dr ___, to let him know how you were doing during this hospital stay. In addition, you tested positive for a minor, reversible kidney injury. We believe this was due to your high blood pressure. As your blood pressure was controlled, your kidney function returned to normal. During your cardiac catheterization, the blood flow to the kidneys was evaluated and determined to be normal. It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ ___ ___.

You presented as a transfer from ___ following clusters of very short-lasting chest pain. You had a heart tracing (ECG) which showed no change from prior. You also had blood tests which show that you have not had a heart attack and a chest X-ray that was unremarkable. It was unclear whether you had relief with nitroglycerine as your chest pains were so short-lived. You were transferred to the ___ where you were assessed by cardiology and given your history, ECG findings and blood tests we were happy that this pain was not related to your heart. You had a nuclear stress test which was unremarkable and as such you were deemed safe to go home. It is currently unclear as to the cause of your symptoms but this may be related to nerve irritability especially in light of your previous shoulder injury and subsequent infection. We started you on a long acting nitrate tablet called Imdur which can help in cases of heart artery spasm as a trial to see if this improves your symptoms. If your chest episodes do not improve with this or you get side-effects this can be stopped. You should ___ with your PCP ___ ___ regarding these pains. . Medication changes: We STARTED Imdur 30mg daily We INCREASED pravastatin to 40mg daily Continue your other medications as prescribed. ","___ with hx of CAD/NSTEMI (IMI, TPA ___ NSTEMI RCA BMS ___, last echo ___ showed EF 47%, PD with ___ Body Dementia was transferred from ___ with CP. Atypical sounding with clusters of CP lasting only les than a second with longest cluster ___ mins in duration without other cardiac sounding features and not similar to previous heart attack. Patient presented to ___ where they found ECG unchanged and was CE negative x2 and was discharged home. Patient had a further cluster and re-presented to ___ and was given nitro paste and was transferred to ___ for a second opinion with the possibility of cath. Here, ECG was unchanged and CEs were negative with flat MB. Was initially treated with nitro paste and latterly with IV heparin infusion which was stopped. Still having chest pain episodes but not distressed by these. Patient was still having similar chest pain episodes but not distressed by these and at much reduced frequency. Given concern of relatives despite having explained that symptoms were not cardiac in origin patient went on to an exercise MIBI which showed a moderate fixed inferior perfusion defect without evidence of reversibility. Patient was started on a trial of Imdur and was discharged on ___ with PCP ___ to address his atypical symptoms. . # CORONARIES/CP: Patient with history of CAD/NSTEMI (IMI, TPA ___ NSTEMI RCA BMS ___ and presents with very atypical chest pain which has been more frequent lately. Patient describes very transient episodes of ""zings"" of pain he has had since his first MI but only very rarely but now increased in frequency and having clusters. Very atypical sounding with clusters of CP episodes individually lasting less than a second with longest cluster of ___ mins in duration (with c20 episodes) without other cardiac sounding features and not similar to previous heart attack pain which was very different and classical. Of note, on the day of presentation, he had no chest pain when he was exerting himself doing yard work. Patient presented to ___ ___ where they found ECG unchanged and was CE negative x2 and was discharged home. Patient had a further cluster and re-presented and was given nitro paste and was transferred to ___ for a second opinion with the possibility of cath. Here he was started on a nitro drip and was pain free until am of ___. ECG was unremarkable and cardiac enzymes were negative here with flat MB. Patient had no rib or chest wall tenderness although given his odd history, these could be musculoskeletal. Patient was still having similar chest pain episodes but not distressed by these and at much reduced frequency. It is unclear as to the etiology of these pains but given the short duration this may be related to nerve irritability from his previous shoulder injury and subsequent infection. The pain sounds potentially neuropathic, and in this light gabapentin may be a possible consideration. Given concern of relatives despite having explained that symptoms were not cardiac in origin patient went on to an exercise MIBI which showed a moderate fixed inferior perfusion defect without evidence of reversibility and akinesis of the inferior wall and otherwise normal wall motion. Patient was therefore deemed safe for discharge from a cardiology standpoint. He was continued on aspirin, pravastatin at increased dose and metoprolol. Patient was started on a trial of Imdur for his symptoms and was discharged on ___ with PCP/cardiology ___ on ___. . # PUMP: Last echo ___ showed mild LVH and EF 47%. Calculated LVEF on myocardial perfusion scan ___ was 49%. Patient had no murmurs on exam or stigmata of CHF. PCP can consider starting ACEI in the community. PCP to consider repeat echocardiogram. . # RHYTHM: NSR. No new changes. . # ___ Disease with ___ Body Dementia: Patient followed by D ___.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to ___ with chest pain and found to have damage to your heart due to a fast heart rate called atrial fibrillation. You were monitored and improved with slowing of your heart rate. You were started on a couple new medications to help prevent this rapid heart rate (Amiodarone) and also Coumadin, a blood thinner to prevent you from having a stroke as a result of the rapid heart rate. The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1. START Coumadin 2 mg daily--a blood thinner to prevent strokes. You will need to have frequent INR (Coumadin level) checks and are being set up with a home visiting nurse to facilitate this. The results will be faxed to Dr. ___ ___ for any necessary adjustments. 2. START Amiodarone 200 mg daily. This is to keep you from going into atrial fibrillation. 3. CHANGE Captopril 12.5 mg PO bid to Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, to reduce the number of pills you have to take daily. This may need to be increased over time depending on your blood pressure. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. ","Patient is a ___ yo male with h/o CAD s/p MI, CABG and PCI in ___, systolic CHF 35%, AAA s/p repair presents with shortness of breath and CP that started this morning. Symptoms are concerning for ACS and PE primarily. Patient has low probability of PE based on history and physical, although he was tachycardic and short of breath. CXR was suspicious for PE if appearance could not be explained by CHF and other alternative diagnoses. Patient has apparent atrial fibrillation w/ RVR, which could make demand ischemia a possible cause of the patient's chest pain. NSTEMI is possible, but EKG changes resolved with rate control. Ultrasound of aorta was done and does not suggest aortic dissection. . #. Chest pain/shortness of breath: The main differential in this patient included acute coronary syndrome vs. demand ischemia from new atrial fibrillation vs. pulmonary embolus vs. atypical chest pain. Patient most likely had poor perfusion of his coronaries due to tachycardia, resulting in demand ischemia. TIMI risk score was 5. History and clinical exam suggested that pulmonary embolus was not likely. Troponin levels and CK-MB levels were elevated with T wave inversions and ST depressions evident on ECG, making NSTEMI likely. The patient was started on heparin drip, and patient was given aspirin, and started on his home regimens of statin, metoprolol, captopril and Imdur. The patient was not plavix loaded on admission. He was monitored on telemetry throughout hospital course. The changes on ECG and chest pain were found to resolve with rate control in the ED via diltiazem drip and nitroglycerin and morphine. His cardiologist, Dr. ___, was contacted, and said that he felt that catheterization would likely be non-revealing and that such a procedure should be avoided unless the patient developed chest pain again. Upon reaching the floor, the patient was chest pain free and remained so throughout hospitalization. He was weaned off the heparin drip within 36 hours of presentation. He occasionally got short of breath when ambulating, but this resolved upon resting, and improved throughout the hospital stay. Cardiac biomarker levels were found to resolve over the course of admission, after elevating originally. The patient was scheduled outpatient follow-up with his primary care provider upon discharge. . #. Atrial fibrillation: the patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and palpitations and shortness of breath, which was controlled with PO and IV diltiazem in the ED. After reaching the floor, the patient was started on his home dose of metoprolol and was maintained on a heparin drip originally. After heparin drip was stopped, it was discussed with the patient about starting anticoagulation as well as antiarrhythmic therapy. Risks and benefits of both treatments were discussed, and the patient and his son agreed that they would like to start treatment with coumadin and amiodarone. Patient was started on these two medications in the hospital, with monitoring of INR, which showed the level to be subtherapeutic on discharge. He was discharged on these two medications, with follow-up scheduled with his primary care provider on ___. The patient was scheduled to have a ___ check his INR level after returning home, with the results to be faxed to his PCP. Amidoarone was started at 400 mg TID in the hospital, then decreased to 200 mg daily upon discharge, in order to simplify the patient's home regimen. These checks will be continued indefinitely in the future, with management by the patient's primary care provider. The patient was in sinus rhythm on discharge, and without symptoms of palpitations. . #.Coronary artery disease: the patient was continued on his home regimen of Imdur, metoprolol, statin and captopril during hospitalization. His captopril was discontinued on discharge, and changed to lisinopril in order to simplify his home medication regimen, and for better control of his congestive heart failure. . #.Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: on admission, the patient was not started on his home dose of lasix, because his creatinine level was elevated from baseline. The patient was given gentle fluids, and creatinine improved, upon which the patient was restarted on his home lasix regimen. Daily weight and ins and outs were recorded, and BUN, creatinine and electrolytes were trended. The patient was on captopril BID upon admission. Echocardiogram was obtained while in the hospital, and showed worsening of the patient's ejection fraction. Chest x-ray showed improved pleural effusions from previous admission. It was decided to switch the patient from captopril BID to lisinopril qdaily to simplify home medication regimen and for better control of the patient's heart failure. . #.Hyperlipidemia: the patient was continued on his home statin dose during admission. . #. Chronic kidney disease: the patient's creatinine level was increased from baseline on admission, from 1.3 to 1.5. Gentle fluids were given, and the patient's creatinine decreased back to baseline. Levels were trended throughout hospitalization. . #.GERD: the patient was administered his home dose of omeprazole throughout admission. . #.Nausea: the patient reported feeling nauseous throughout the course of admission, and was discharged with ondanestron for control of this symptom. . #.Chest x-ray abnormality: X-ray taken before discharge showed possible calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, which may need to be followed up upon discharge with the patient's primary care provider.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to ___ because there was concern you were having a heart attack (called an NSTEMI). While you were here, we did a cardiac catheterization to look at the arteries around your heart. This showed that you had blockages in one of the arteries and we put two stents in to keep the artery open. It is crucial that you continue to take aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel) to prevent your stents from clotting, which would cause another heart attack. You were continued on hemodialysis while in the hospital and this was used to manage your fluids and prevent you from going into heart failure. You completed a course of antibiotics (vancomycin) for a C. diff infection of your colon. We did CT scans of your chest because there was concern that you might have had some bleeding. It showed signs that your aorta bled a little because of its enlargement, but then stopped and contained itself. It did not show any signs of active bleeding but you should follow up with a vascular surgeon to make sure that everything looks good. We discussed the value of anticoagulation (blood thinners) given that you have atrial fibrillation and are at increased risk of stroke. You were very clear that you did not want to start warfarin. Unfortunately, no other blood thinners are safe given your kidney disease. We also made several changes to the medications used to control your heart rate and blood pressure. Your updated medications are detailed in your discharge medication list. You should review this carefully and take it with you to any follow up appointments. You will have follow up appointments with your cardiologist and a vascular surgeon for your aorta. After you finish rehabilitation, you will also be set up with an appointment with your primary care doctor. We expect your stay at the ___ to be less than 30 days. It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you all the best.

He awoke in the morning feeling well, and worked on his car (changed a bulb, which involved laying under the car). Afterward he was returning to his house and he climbed up 10 steps when he had sudden onset of substernal chest pain. It was ___ severity, constant. He took SL nitroglycerin x 4 or 5 doses with no significant relief. He also took Tylenol and Maalox without improvement. He began to feel diaphoretic and uncomfortable, so called his family, who called EMS to bring him to ED. . Of note, he has generally been feeling well for the past few months. He feels his CHF has been under good control, with minimal edema, orthopnea or PND. However, he does report increasingly frequent exertional angina (typically with carrying groceries or walking longer distances) over the past few weeks for which he has taken SLNG a few times per week. . In the ED, his initial vitals were T 97, HR 104, BP 84/50, RR 16, O2 100% 2L NC. An EKG was performed and showed LBBB which met Sgarbossa criteria for evolving myocardial infarction. He was given full-dose aspirin and plavix-loaded and taken to the cardiac cath lab. There, cath revealed complete stenosis of his RCA graft (felt likely to be old, as wire could not be passed) and 99% proximal stenosis of his LAD graft. A drug-eluting stent was placed in this location with subsequent good flow noted. Given hypotension to SBP in ___ during the procedure, a balloon pump was placed. . On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling significantly better than earlier in the day and is chest-pain free. He is on 2L O2 by NC but denies SOB at rest. Cannot urinate from the supine position, but otherwise no complaints at this time. . On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. No dysuria. No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

You were admitted for a heart attack and underwent a procedure in which they re-opened a blocked vessel in your heart. Your blood pressures were a bit low during the procedure so you were initially monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit while a balloon pump temporarily supported your pressures but that was successfully removed. You recovered from your procedure well enough to be sent to the regular hospital floor. . The following medications were changed during your hospitalization: 1. Stop taking your Pravastatin 40mg daily and instead start taking Atorvastatin 80mg daily to lower your cholesterol. 2. Please start taking Plavix 75mg daily. 3. While you were in the hospital, you were on Furosemide 80mg daily which is lower than your typical home dose. We would like for you to weigh yourself tomorrow morning after you urinate and write down the weight, this will be your baseline weight. Continue to weigh yourself on the same scale everyday. If you gain 3lbs in one day a) call Dr. ___ b) please take an additional 40mg of Furosemide (Lasix) that evening. 4. While you were in the hospital, we did not give you your daily Spironolactone 25mg because your blood pressures were low. Please do not resume taking your spironolactone until you have discussed this with Dr. ___. 5. Please stop taking your omeprazole and start taking ranitidine 150mg daily for your heartburn. . Please continue taking all of your other home medications. ","Pt is a ___ with CAD s/p CABG and prior PCI who presented with chest pain and EKG changes consistent with inferior wall STEMI. . # Inferior Wall STEMI - Pt presented with chest pain and EKG changes consistent with inferior wall MI with peak CKMB of 41 and troponin of 1.03. Pt underwent urgent cardiac catheterization for revascularization. In the cath lab, initial angiography revealed an occluded SVG-RCA. Attempts were made to cross the occlusion with multiple wires. At this point, the patient's blood pressures dropped, so an IABP was inserted via the right femoral artery. They then accessed the left femoral artery, and repeat angiography of the SVG-LAD revealed a 95% stenosis at its ostium. They treated this lesion with PTCA and one drug-eluting stent. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no evidence of dissection and TIMI 3 flow. Patient was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring. He was stable enough to be transferred to the floor. Post-procedure Echo showed EF of 30%, which was similar to his previous baseline. He was discharged home on an appropriate post-MI regimen including plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. Patient was trialed on a low-dose beta-blocker but he became quite bradycardic so it had to be discontinued. . # Hypotension - Patient became hypotensive during the procedure requiring placement of IABP. On arrival to the CCU, pt's pressures were quite stable, so pt was successfully weaned off the IABP on ___. Pt's blood pressures remained in the low 100s until the time of discharge, which is likely his baseline as he was mentating appropriately and clinically quite stable. . CHRONIC ISSUES . # Congestive Heart Failure: Repeat Echo on this admission showed essentially no change in pt's EF post-STEMI - it remained depressed at ___. Pt remained euvolemic throughout his stay, complaining only of some minor shortness of breath when lying flat. His blood pressures remained in the low 100s, so he could not be fully re-started on all of his home medications prior to discharge. His spironolactone was held and his lasix dose was decreased to 80mg daily at the time of discharge. He was advised to follow-up with his primary doctor to re-add/titrate these medications appropriately. . # Chronic Renal Failure: Pt's creatinine was initially elevated post-procedure likely from the contrast load he received, but it gradually returned to baseline without any further intervention. . # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt was consistently bradycardic and in sinus rhythm post-procedure. His bradycardia prevented us from successfully starting a beta-blocker on him. He was continued on amiodarone. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES . Pt needs to follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist regarding the appropriate doses of lasix and spironolactone he needs to be on given his low blood pressures. A beta-blocker should be started in him as well if his heart rate can tolerate it. ",2705,666,12

The catheterization found one severe blockage in your left circumflex artery and a drug eluting stent was placed to keep the artery open. There was another less severe blockage that was not treated but your new medicines will help to keep it open. It is extremely important that you take a full dose aspirin and Clopidogrel (Plavix) every day for at least one year. Do not stop taking aspirin and plavix or miss any doses unless Dr. ___ that it is OK to do so. The shortness of breath that you experienced in the last month seems to be because of a stiff heart that is called diastolic congestive heart failure. This is caused by your high blood pressure and can be prevented with the medicines you are taking. It is very important to watch for signs of fluid retention in your hands, feet and trouble breathing with exercise. You will also need to weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. . We made the following changes to your medicines: 1. INCREASE the Lisinopril to 40 mg daily to lower your blood pressure 2. START taking Amlodipine to lower your blood pressure 3. STOP taking Atenolol, take Metoprolol instead to lower your heart rate 4. START taking clopidogrel (plavix) every day to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing a heart attack. Continue to take 4 baby aspirin every day with the clopidogrel for the same reason. 5. START taking nitroglycerin as needed if you have chest pain at home or if you become short of breath suddenly. Take one tablet under your tongue, wait 5 minutes, then take another tablet. Call Dr. ___ the nitroglycerin helps the chest pain or trouble breathing, call ___ if you feel it is worsening. 6. START taking Atorvastatin to lower your cholesterol and prevent the blockages in your arteries from getting worse. 7. START taking Furosemide daily to prevent fluid retention.

Patient was treated with ASA 325mg PO daily, lisinopril 30mg PO daily, atorvastatin 20mg PO daily, clopidogrel 75mg PO daily, and metoprolol tartrate. She was initially on NTG gtt on admission to CCU which was tapered. Patient did complain of mild chest/neck discomfort on evening of ___, with EKG showing diffuse TWI but negative cardiac enzymes x2. Most likely noncardiac chest pain. She remained clinically stable and was called out to the floor on ___. She was discharged the next day on ___ after BP control was achieved. . # DYSPNEA: multifactorial etiology. Patient has pulmonary edema and elevated BNP, with cardiac cath showing LVEDP 30. Pulmonary edema may have occurred in the setting of hypertension and myocardiac ischemia causing diastolic dysfunction. She does not have any wall motion abnormalities on echo so myocardial infarction less likely etiology. In addition, patient has underlying COPD which may be contributing. Because she received IV contrast in the cath lab, patient given slow IV fluids in CCU, and was also given Lasix 20mg IV to start diuresis. She diuresed >2L to this, and was then started on Lasix 10mg PO daily. Pt also treated with lisinopril and metoprolol. . # COPD - does have poor air entry but no significant wheezes on exam, so no need for systemic therapy. Treated with albuterol and tiotropium nebs. . # Metabolic Acidosis - On admission pt had gap acidosis with pH 7.3 with lactate of 4. Acidosis has now resolved, with pH 7.42 and lactate 1.2. Possible that in the setting of flash pulmonary edema, she had tachycardia with underlying diastolic dysfunction and consequent low cardiac output state, resulting in lactic acidosis; this seems to have resolved. . # HTN - treated with lisinopril + metoprolol. Also on NTG gtt while in CCU. Upon transfer to the floor, BP was still elevated to SBPs in the 170s and amlodipine was added. . # Depression - continued home fluoxetine and ativan PRN . # Alcohol abuse - did not score on CIWA.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? -========= - You were admitted because you had a heart attack WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? -- - You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest pain. You were found to have had a heart attack. Your heart arteries were examined (cardiac catheterization) which showed a blockage of one of the arteries. This was opened by placing a tube called a stent in the artery. You were given medications to prevent future blockages. - It is very important to take your aspirin and Clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) every day. - These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. - If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot forming in your heart stents and having another heart attack - Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to your heart doctor. - You are also on other new medications to help your heart, such as atorvastatin and metoprolol. - You are also being started on a medication to protect you from stroke since you had a heart attack affecting the motion of your heart, Xarelto (Rivaroxaban), which you should take every day at the same time with your largest meal - You are being discharged with a Life Vest (wearable defibrillator). It is important that you wear it every day as it can detect and treat fatal arrhythmias. You need to wear this for at least three months. Do not remove until instructed to do so by a cardiologist. WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? --== - Follow up with your doctors as below - PLEASE MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A CARDIOLOGIST OR ASK YOUR PCP FOR ___ REFERRAL - If you cannot find a cardiologist within 2 business days, please call ___ for an appointment with ___ ___ - Take all of your medications as prescribed - Return to the hospital if you have chest pain, shortness of breath and if your Life Vest alerts you. Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish you all the best! Your ___ Healthcare Team ","Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMHx notable for tobacco abuse, with current use, who presented with STEMI found to have two vessel coronary artery disease with acute thrombosis of the mid LAD s/p DES and chronic total occlusion of the mid RCA with recannulized/collateral flow. Her hospital course was complicated by paroxysmal SVT and a newly depressed EF with apical hypokinesis in the setting of her acute anterior MI. # STEMI: # CAD: Patient presented with STE in leads I, aVL, V2-4 and initial troponin elevation to 0.05. CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Patient was bolused and maintained on a heparin gtt, given SL nitroglycerin x 2 and was started on a nitroglycerin gtt with relief in symptoms. She was taken from the ED directly to the cath lab. She underwent LHC via right radial access and was found to have a complete occlusion of the LAD (culprit lesion) and a chronic total occlusion of the RCA with recannulized flow. A DES was placed in the LAD and patient was continued on tirofaban. The procedure was well tolerated however was complicated by self limited atrial tachycardia. She was subsequently started on DAPT aspirin and ticagrelor. TTE showed a newly depressed EF of 35% and apical hypokinesis. Patient was subsequently initiated on triple therapy as prophylaxis against LV thrombus. Due to elevated bleeding risk with ticagrelor in addition to systemic AC, patient was switched to aspirin, Clopidogrel (loaded ___ and rivaroxaban. To treat her CAD, she was continued on aspirin, atorvastatin and metoprolol succinate. Troponins peaked at 3.76 and MB at 243. Patient will follow up with new cardiologist in ___ system or ___ if she cannot find a cardiologist. # Apical Hypokinesis: Lumason TTE without evidence of apical thrombus/mass. However given apical hypokinesis with focal akinesis, and low risk of bleeding, patient was started on systemic anticoagulation in addition to DAPT as prophylaxis against LV thrombus. She also had an episode on telemetry that was suspicious for Atrial Fibrillation, which was thought to be another indication for anticoagulation. Patient was switched from ticagrelor to clopidogrel to decrease bleeding risk on triple therapy. She was continued on rivaroxaban 20mg daily, clopidogrel 75mg daily, and aspirin 81mg. Systemic anticoagulation, in addition to DAPT, should be continued for a minimum of 1 month after that she can considered to have aspirin discontinued although continuing triple therapy for up to 3 months is reasonable if she is tolerating well. At 3 months, she should have repeat transthoracic echocardiogram and evaluation of any arrhythmia on the lifevest. If no arrhythmia is documented, and there is no LV thrombus, she can remain on DAPT (i.e. discontinue rivaroxaban). If there is need for ongoing anticoagulation, aspirin can be discontinued at that time and she can continue double therapy with ticagrelor (switch from clopidogrel) and rivaroxaban. # HFrEF: Newly depressed EF 35%. TTE notable for apical hypokinesis with focal apical akinesis, however no thrombus/mass on Lumason TTE. RV had normal free wall function. Given EF 35%, young age, and large anterior wall MI patient was given a Life Vest wearable defibrillator. She was continued on metoprolol to control SVT however due to low normal systolic blood pressures, ACEinh/spironolactone could not be started prior to discharge. # SVT: Hospital course complicated by SVT with heart rates in the 120-150s. Rhythm was suspicious for AVNRT. This resolved with beta blocker therapy that was ulitimately uptitrated to metoprolol succinate 25mg BID. There was concern for short burst of atrial fibrillation and patient will be monitored with the Life Vest for arrhythmias. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] ___ revealed a chronically occluded RCA with recanalized and collateral flow that was not intervened upon. Following revasculariztion of the LAD, it appears that collateral flow to RCA is also improved. Given residual CAD this can be considered for intervention pending follow-up TTE and consideration of an outpatient stress test to evaluate for residual ischemia. [ ] Discharged on triple therapy for new DES and LV thrombus prophylaxis in the setting of apical hypokinesis with potential paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Patient should have at least one month of triple therapy with DAPT (asa, Clopidogrel) + DoAC given her significant infarct and residual disease with an overall low bleeding risk. After one month then may consider stopping aspirin. If aspirin is stopped could consider switching back to ticagrelor with rivaroxaban given large territory anterior MI. Systemic anticoagulation should be continued for three months for LV thrombus prophylaxis. Continuing beyond three months may depend on Afib diagnosis/burden and bleeding risk. [ ] Newly depressed EF of 35%. Given young age and large anterior MI, patient was discharged with Life Vest wearable defibrillator. She should have a repeat TTE in ___ weeks to reassess EF and subsequent TTE in 90 days to evaluate for need for ICD unless patient satisfies indication for an ICD prior to that. [ ] Patient noted to have multiple episodes of SVT during and following her coronary intervention. Following adequate beta blockade these episodes resolved. Of note telemetry review revealed an interval that appeared consistent with atrial fibrillation. Patient will be discharged with life vest that can be reviewed for further interrogation of rhythm. She was discharged on metoprolol succinate 25MG BID daily and on systemic anticoagulation. [ ] Patient was counseled on smoking cessation. She was prescribed a nicotine patch during her hospitalization and at time of discharge. She may benefit from additional resources as an outpatient. [ ] Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation when cleared by Cardiologist ",3303,1340,12

LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems. LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 70% stenosis in the proximal segment. Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 90% stenosis in the proximal segment. RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 95% stenosis in the proximal and mid segments. Interventional Details Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad hoc basis based on the coronary angiographic findings from the diagnostic portion of this procedure. It was unclear if the LCx or the RCA were the culprit. ECG was not helpful in localizing. There was TIMI 2 flow in the RCA and thus we decided to fix first. heparin boluses were given prophylactically for an ACT >250s and the patient was pre-loaded with 180 mg of Ticagrelor. A ___ Fr AL0.75 guide provided good support for the procedure. A short Sion Blue wire crossed easily into the distal RPL. We pre-dilated with a 2.5*15 mm balloon at 14 ATM for ___ x3. We then delivered a 2.75*38 mm Promus Elite DES at 14 ATM for ___ and then an overlapping 3.0*20 mm Promus Elite at 16 ATM for ___. We then post-dilated with a 3.0 mm NC balloon distally and with a 4.0 mm NC balloon proximally at 20 ATM for ___ x6. Final angiogram showed no residual and TIMI 3 flow without any visible evidence of dissection or rupture. We now turned our attention to the LCx. A ___ Fr. EBU 3.5 guide provided poor support for the procedure. A short Sion Blue crossed the lesion easily into the OM and we then predilated with a 2.5 mm balloon at 14 ATM and then delivered a 2.75*20 mm Promus Elite DES at 14 ATM for ___ and post-dilated with a 3.0 mm NC balloon at 20 ATM fro ___ and then with a 3.5 mm NC balloon at 20 ATM for ___.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? -========= - You went to ___ because you were having chest pain. You had abnormal cardiac testing indicating you were having a heart attack, ST elevation myocardial infarction, (STEMI). You were transferred to ___ for further care. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? -- - You had a cardiac catheterization procedure. This showed significant coronary artery disease. - You had 2 stents placed to the right coronary artery (RCA) and on stent placed in the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx). You also have a 70% blockage of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). You had an episode of atrial fibrillation, irregular heart rhythm which requires an anticoagulation medication, apixaban (Eliquis), to decrease your risk for stroke. - You were started on new medications to best treat your heart disease. WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? --== - Instructions regarding care of the access site are included with your discharge information. - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below). There are a lot of new medication changes. STOP Humalog insulin STOP Aspirin STOP Lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide STOP Amlodipine STOP Rosuvastatin Start NPH insulin take 40 units daily with breakfast, 10 units before dinner daily. Please take Atorvastatin 80mg, daily (best absorbed when taken in the evening), this medication not only reduces cholesterol, but has been shown to help decrease risk of heart attack in the future for people who have coronary artery (heart) disease. NITRO Nitroglycerin is a medication that can be used as needed for chest pain. If you develop chest pain, place 1 tablet under the tongue and allow it to dissolve. If after 5 minutes you are still having chest pain, you can repeat this every 5 minutes for UP TO 3 doses. If chest pain persists after 3 doses, call ___. You should always lie down if you need to take this medication, because it can cause a drop in your blood pressure which can lead to lightheadedness or possibly cause someone to pass out if blood pressure drops too low. Even if your chest pain resolves, you should contact your cardiologist METOPROLOL 37.5mg daily. This medication belongs to a class of medications known as Beta Blockers. Beta blockers slow the heart down and can lower blood pressure. They help reduce the amount of work the heart has to do, and can help to reduce risk of future heart attack. LISINOPRIL 5mg daily. This medication belongs to a class of medications known as Ace Inhibitors. Ace Inhibitors help to reduce blood pressure and decrease the amount of resistance that the heart needs to pump against, which decreases strain on the heart muscle. It can also help to protect/improve kidney function in some individuals Plavix (clopidogel) 75mg daily - It is very important to take all of your heart healthy medications. In particular, Plavix (clopidogrel) help keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop this medication or miss ___ dose, a blood clot could form in your heart stent which could cause a life threatening heart attack. Please do not stop taking either medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications. - We have ordered a cardiac monitor for you to wear to monitor your heart rate and rhythm at home. The information will be sent to the cardiologist, Dr. ___. - It is strongly recommended that you attend a cardiac rehab program in the near future. A referral form was provided to you that lists the locations of these programs. Please bring this with you to your follow up visit with your cardiologist, and they will inform you when it is safe to begin a program. - Follow up with your doctors as listed below. - An Appointment for ___ was requested, they should contact you with a 1 to 2 week follow up appointment time next week.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL? - You were admitted to the hospital because you had a heart attack which exacerbated your heart failure, as well as a COPD flare WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL? - You had an echocardiogram (or ultrasound of your heart) to assess your heart function. This showed that your heart is not able to pump as well as it should. - You had a coronary angiogram test to look at the vessels in your heart. This showed that 3 of your coronary arteries had coronary artery disease with blockage. - You were seen by the cardiac surgeons who initially thought you would benefit from a heart surgery. However, after your lung function was assessed, it was determined that you would not be a good surgical candidate. - You had lung function tests and a CT of your chest. These showed that you have severe COPD. You were seen by the ___ (lung doctors) team and they are planning to see you again once you leave the hospital. - You had a coronary catheterization with placement of a stent in one of the vessels in your heart to allow for more blood flow. - You developed a large hematoma, or bruise, on your right forearm near the area of the catheterization entry. This was monitored closely during your stay and it was determined that no intervention was needed for your bruise. - You had a TIA, or mini stroke, shortly after your cardiac catheterization, which caused you to lose strength in your left forearm and hand. You were seen by the neurology team and you had a CT scan and MRI of your brain which suggested you had a TIA. You are scheduled to see the neurology team again for follow up when you leave the hospital. - You were seen by the physical therapy team after your TIA. They suggested that you continue to work with physical therapy and occupational therapy upon discharge from the hospital to help you regain your strength. WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? - You should continue to take your medications as prescribed. - You should attend the appointments listed below. - Your discharge weight: 123.02 lb. You should use this as your baseline after you leave the hospital. - Weigh yourself every morning, and call your doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant demonstrated significant coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no obstructive disease. The LAD was totally occluded at the ostium. The LCX had 50% serial lesions. The RCA had 50% right to left collaterals. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed normal central aortic pressure (107/53 with a mean of 69 mmHg). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Total occlusion of the LAD 2. successful primary PCI of the LAD with restoration of TIMI 3 flow Echo ___: Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral walls as well as distal septal and inferior hypokinesis and dyskinesis of the true apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of the aortic sinus and ascending aorta are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD (LAD distribution), with moderately depressed overall systolic function. Normal right ventricular size and free wall systolic function. ECG ___: Sinus rhythm with a slightly prolonged computed P-R interval and persistently prolonged computed Q-T interval.

Do not stop taking aspirin and clopidogrel for any reason or miss any doses unless your cardiologist tells you it it OK to do so. Your heart is weak after the heart attack and we have started you on many medications to help the heart heal. Because the heart is weak, there is an increased risk of blood clots so you will be started on warfarin, a blood thinner, to prevent blood clots until the heart is stronger. Warfarin takes about 3 days to start to work so you will take an enoxaparin injection twice daily to prevent blood clots. Dr. ___ will tell you when the warfarin level is high enough so that you can stop the injections. ","Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ Hx of non-hodgkins Lymphoma, PAD, AAA and heavy smoking who presented w/ STEMI, found to have multiple LAD lesions s/p BMS x 3.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> It has been a privilege to take care of you at ___ ___. You were hospitalized because you had a heart attack - the symptom of your heart attack was shortness of breath. Heart attacks are caused by blockages in the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle, whose pumping function depends on a constant supply of oxygen delivered by the blood supplied by these arteries. Severe blockages in the coronary arteries can cause the symptoms that you experienced because they deprive your heart of oxygen. . During this hospitalization, the blockage in your posterior lateral coronary artery that was causing your symptoms was opened during a procedure called a cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, a balloon was inflated to open the blocked, restore blood flow through the artery and, in turn, restore oxygen supply to your heart muscle. This procedure should help to improve your symptoms. . The catheterization, however, is only one part of your treatment; the other part of your treatment is your new medication regimen. It is very important that you take all of the medications prescribed to you because they will help to prevent you from having future heart attacks and help ensure that your pre-existing stents remains open. . Your new heart medications are: # CONTINUE: Aspirin 81mg daily - will need to take lifelong # START: Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg daily - will need to take for at least one year # CONTINUE: Crestor 40mg daily # START: Carvedilol 50mg twice daily, STOP labetalol # START: Lisinopril 20mg daily # CONTINUE: Sublingual Nitroglycerin **Take 1 tab if you experience chest pain. If the pain persists, take a ___ tab 5 minutes after taking the first. If the pain still persists, take a ___ tab 5 minutes after taking the ___. If the pain still persists, call ___ and call your cardiologist.** . Your blood pressure was very high while you were here, and we made several changes to your blood pressure medications. Your new blood pressure regimen is as follows: # START carvedilol 50mg twice daily (STOP labetalol) # CONTINUE guanfacine 2mg daily # INCREASE hydralazine to 50mg three times daily # INCREASE Nifedpine to 60mg twice daily # START lisinopril 20mg daily # START furosemide 20mg daily . Please continue to take all of your other medications as previously prescribed. . It is also very important that you attend all of the follow-up appointments detailed below. Moreover, if you ever have chest pain associated with sweating, nausea or vomiting, or shortness of breath that does not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin after 3 doses, please call ___ and call your cardiologist immediately because you may be having another heart attack. . You were also hospitalized because you had an acute worsening of your pre-existing heart failure - your symptoms were lower extremity swelling and shortness of breath. . You have diastolic congestive heart failure, which is a condition in which the filling function of your heart is impaired. As a result of your heart's impaired filling function, you are prone to accumulating excess fluid in parts of the body where fluid should not normally be; fluid that accumulates in the lower extremities causes swelling, and fluid that accumulates in the lungs causes shortness of breath. Your heart behaves like the water pumping stations that pump water out of a reservoir constantly being filled by an upstream river. If the pump is not filling properly, water flowing in from the river does not get pumped out of the reservoir and instead overflows onto the surrounding land. Similarly, if your heart is not pumping properly, fluid can overflow into your lungs and legs. . During this hospitalization, you were given medicines that removed the exess fluid from your body and your heart medicines were optimized; however, what we have done for you in the hospital is not the end of your treatment. . It is very important that you adhere to the fluid restrictions prescribed and that you refrain from consuming salt; failure to do so may result in you accumulating excess fluid and requiring re-hospitalization. You must also take all of the medications prescribed. Your current heart regimen is as follows: # Weigh yourself daily; call your cardiologist if you gain more than 3 lbs over your current weight, which is 175 lbs. # Lisinopril 20mg daily # Lasix 20mg daily # Potassium 10 mg twice daily # Carvedilol 50mg twice daily . During this hospitalization, your kidney function worsened slightly, but it normalized toward your baseline prior to your discharge. You should follow-up with your nephrologist after your discharge. ","___ gentleman with 2VD CAD s/p RCA stent and LAD stent with known mild ISR in ___, complete heart block s/p pacemaker in ___, CKD, severe OSA on CPAP, HTN, and seizure disorder, who initially presented to his nephrologist for SOB concerning for PE, who ruled out for PE but was found to have NSTEMI, and underwent cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty of the RPL1 on ___. . ACTIVE ISSUES: . # NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's anginal equivalent was shortness of breath; EKG showed A-V sequential pacing and was similar to prior tracings. CK/MB was 188/6 and Trop was <0.01 on admission; peak CK/MB was 6 and peak troponin was 0.10. The patient was chest pain free during this time. He had previously been started on a heparin gtt given concern for PE. Was also on started on aspirin 325mg, and continued on home regimen of Labetalol 600mg BID and Rosuvastatin 40mg daily. He underwent cardiac catheterization on ___ via the right femoral artery. Initial angiography revealed RPL1 with diffuse disease throughout to 80% proximally and 45% mid stenoses, and patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the proximal RPL1 (was felt to be too small to stent). Angioseal was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there was no evidence of hematoma or aneurysm at the insertion site post-procedure. The patient had been on labetalol 600mg BID; this was changed to carvedilol 50mg BID for better blood pressure control. He was started on lisinporil 20mg daily. The patient was discharged chest pain free on 81mg aspirin daily, as well as Plavix 75mg daily for secondary prevention. He should be on aspirin life-long, and Plavix for at least 12 months. His regimen also includes carvedilol, lisinopril, and rosuvastatin, as well as hydralazine. . # ___ Decompensation: The patient's shortness of breath was likely multifactorial in setting NSTEMI and dCHF exacerbation. Patient has normal LV systolic function, demonstrated on TTE ___, and cardiac cath ___ revealed severe LV diastolic heart failure. The patient received lasix initially, then was diuresed with torsemide. At time of discharge, the patient was felt to be euvolemic, without cardiac wheezing, JVD, or lower extremity edema. The patient was discharged on a heart failure regimen of carvedilol, lisinopril, fluid restriction of 1500 mL, and a low Na diet. He will start on furosemide 20mg daily as an outpatient. . # HTN: The patient has a history of difficult to control blood pressure, and had persistent hypertension during much of his hospital course, with occasional SBPs in 190s-low 200s. Patient was asymptomatic during these episodes, denying any headache, dizziness, blurred vision, chest pain, or worsening dyspena. His anti-hypertensive regimen was changed as follows: Labetalol switched to carvedilol 50mg PO BID. Hydralazine was increased to 50mg TID. Nifedpine was increased to 60mg BID. Lisinopril 20mg daily was added back to regimen. Guanfacine was continued at 2mg daily. On morning of discharge, BP control had significantly improved, with SBP generally ranging 120s-150s. . # ___ CKD: Patient's recent baseline Cr around 1.8-2.0. Cr peaked at 2.3 this admission, and ___ was likely secondary to pre-renal etiology. Cr was closely monitored in setting of aggressive diuresis and dye load from cardiac catheterization. The patient's Cr had trended back to baseline prior to discharge. . # OSA: Maintained on home CPAP. . INACTIVE/CHRONIC ISSUES: . # h/o Seizure: Maintained on home regimen of Trileptal 300mg twice daily. . # Gout: Maintained on home regimen of Allopurinol ___ twice daily. . # GERD: Maintained on home regimen of Prilosec 20mg twice daily. . # Iron deficiency anemia: Maintained on home regimen of Iron 65mg daily. . # PTSD/Depression: Maintained on home regimen of Celexa 40mg daily. . # BPH: Maintained on home regimen of Terazosin 10mg daily. . # Supplementation: Maintained on home regimen of Fish Oil 2400mg daily, Vitamin D 1000mg daily, Resveratrol 200mg daily (supplement), Vitamin B12 1000mg daily. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient will follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ will need cardiac rehab. -His blood pressure will be closely monitoring in outpatient setting, and patient was discharged home with ___ and telemonitoring services. -Code status: Patient was full code during this admission.

","___ year-old male with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transfered for cardiac catheterization s/p stent to DES to LIMA-LAD, course complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation. #. Coronary artery disease: The patient had symptoms concerning for unstable angina and presented to an OSH. At that time he had a slight increase in cardiac enzymes. There were no EKGs from the outside hospital. The patient was maintained on aspirin, heparin gtt, high-dose atorvastatin, plavix and metoprolol tartrate. He had a cardiac catheterization the morning of admission finding in-stent restenosis of ostial SVG->OM stent and LIMA->LAD. The patient had a DES in the SVG-OM. The patient developed agitation in the cath suite and was transfered to the cardiac ICU for further monitoring. It was thought to be secondary to a paradoxical effect of the benzos he was given during the procedure. He was resent to the Cath lab and had a successful PCI of the LIMA-LAD with DES. The patient was discharged on metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin and plavix. He had one episode of chest pain without EKG changes or cardiac enzyme elevations. He received 1mg of morphine which relieved his pain. He was hemodynamically stable at discharge. He should follow up with an outpatient cardiologist within 2 weeks of discharge. #. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure and respiratory failure: A TTE was done which showed decreased EF of ___. The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was diuresed and quickly extubated to a BiPAP. He was quickly weaned to face mask and then 3L NC. He receieved an 8 day course of vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator associated pneumonia. He was weaned slowly off of oxygen and had no oxygen requirement upon discharge. The patient was discharged on diuretics with torsemide 30 mg daily. #. Delirium: The patient initially had both hypoactive and hyperactive delirium; hypoactive delirium resolved, but hyperactive delirium at night persisted for weeks with gradual resolution. Initially it was thought to be secondary to paradoxical effect of benzos. Usual precautions were done including minimizing lines, frequent orientation, etc. The patient was started on large standing doses of seroquel in the evening with an additional smaller morning doses. His QTc was not prolonged. He was followed by both geriatrics and psychiatry throughout his hospitalization. Despite an improvement in delirium the patient had persistent difficulty with behavioral control. Despite aggressive medical management the patient had continued difficulty. He was started on trazadone and seroquel with some improvement. His dose was changed to seroquel 25mg qAM, 100mg qHS and 25mg given at midday to attempt to prevent increased agitation in the late afternoon. He continues on trazodone 50mg qHS. Per psychiatry, pt should be wslowly weaned off the Seroquel but discontinuing the day time dose in about 2 weeks, then decrease the bedtime dose by 25 mg per week until off. . #. Sinus tachycardia: The patient had sinus tachycardia. He was evaluated for potential pathological causes and none were found. The likely etiology was volume depletion and agitation. As the patient's delirium improved the tachycardia improved. #. Nutrition: The patient required an NG tube for medications and tube feeds while in the ICU. The tube was removed and he was able to eat and take medications by mouth. Speech and swallow evaluated the patient was cleared for a full diet with supervision. #. Diabetes mellitus: The patient was continued on insulin NPH at bedtime and in the morning as well as an insulin sliding scale. #. EtOH abuse: He was initially monitored on valium per CIWA scale. A social work consult was ordered. The patient showed no signs of withdrawal. #. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin per above. #. Hypertension: continued medications per above. #.

You were admitted because you had a heart attack. Images of your heart showed that critical vessels that supply blood to your heart were blocked, and so a stent was placed in order to keep the blood vessel open. it is extremely important that you take aspirin and plavix every day for one year to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack. Do not stop taking aspirin and plavix or miss any doses unless Dr. ___ it is OK. You developed a very common irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. You have tolerated this well but you now have an increased risk of stroke. Therefore, we have started ___ blood thinner called Dabigitran or Pradaxa to prevent a stroke. This medicine can cause easy bleeding so you may bruise easily or your gums could bleed with vigorous brushing. However, you also could have bleeding in your bowel that will give you dark or bloody stools, lightheadedness and dizziness. Call Dr. ___ away if you experience these symptoms. Please START taking the following medications in addition to your home medications: 1. Metoprolol succinate to lower your heart rate and help you heart recover from the heart attack 2. Rosuvastatin (Crestor) to lower your cholesterol 3. Plavix to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack. 4. Aspirin to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack. 5. Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover 6. Pradaxa: to prevent a stroke from your atrial fibrillation Please STOP taking the following medications: 1. Amlodipine (the Lisinipril will replace Amlodipine) 2. Atenolol (the Metoprolol will replace Atenolol) ","Mr. ___ is a ___ M with history of HTN and OSA, who was admitted with an inferior STEMI. . ACUTE # Inferior STEMI - Pt taken to cath and shown to have a subtotal ostium occlusion in the posterolateral branch of the RCA. There was successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA into the posterolateral branch with a 3.0 x 18 mm Promus drug-eluting stent. He was continued on aspirin and started on plavix, ACEI, statin, and switched to metoprolol from his home atenolol. . # CHF: No history of CHF but has not had an echo since stress echo in ___. ECHO showed EF 45-50% with mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, Mild-moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, and dilated thoracic aorta. . # RHYTHM: Evidence of first degree AV block on EKG back in ___ ___s now. He was monitored on telemetry and found to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was anticoagulated with heparin drip and bridged to Pradaxa for long-term anticoagulation. . CHRONIC # Hypertension: His home amlodipine was held in favor of starting ACEI, and he was switched from his home atenolol to metoprolol for better cardioprotection. He was slowly titrated up to 50 mg metoprolol BID, which was equivalent to his home atenolol dose. He was also put on lisinopril 5mg. . # Hyperlipidemia: Per notes, he has history of hyperlipidemia,but patient reports good cholesterol levels. Lipid panel showed HDL 43, CHOL/HDL 4.0, LDL 104. He was started on atorvastatin 80mg daily for cardioprotection. . # Obstructive Sleep Apnea: He was continued on CPAP. . # BPH: He was continued on home tamulosin and finasteride. . # Low testosterone: Wife reports pt takes 200mg every 2 weeks.

CATHETERIZATION REPORT: ESTIMATED blood loss: 30 mL Hemodynamics (see above): Preserved aortic pressure at baseline. Post-angiography, the PCW was moderately elevated at 19 mm Hg with RV ___ and PA 35/___ mm Hg. There was no oxygen step-up from the SVC to the PA post-PCI. The calculated cardiac index was lightly decreased at 2.3 L/min/m2 using an assumed oxygen consumption. Coronary angiography: right dominant LMCA: The LMCA was long with likely moderate diffuse disease, as it appeared smaller than expected with mild plaquing mid vessel. LAD: A long S1 had a 70% origin stenosis. The LAD was severely diseased after S1 with a recanalized total vs. subtotal occlusion after a small caliber/diffusely diseased D2. There was modest filling of the mid-distal LAD and a large D2 beyond the functional total occlusion. There were septal and apical collaterals filling the RPDA and D2 collaterals supplying the RPL. LCX: The CX gave off two high large and modest caliber OM branches. OM3 was small. OM4 was of modest caliber. OM5/LPL was long with minimal luminal irregularities. The distal AV groove CX continued beyond the LPL. RCA: The RCA was calcified with a proximal total occlusion with railroad tracking beyond in the mid RCA suggesting a large thrombus burden. There was faint filling of the RCA beyond the total occlusion (TIMI 0 flow). Assessment & Recommendations 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with likely functional chronic total occlusion (? recanalized total occlusion vs. subtotal occlusion) of the mid LAD with collaterals connecting the distal LAD and major D2 with the RPDA and RPL respectively and likely acute thrombotic occlusion of the diffusely diseased RCA. 2. Moderate elevation of PCW consistent with moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure. 3. No evidence of significant intra-cardiac shunting. 4. Successful deployment of 3 drug-eluting stent to the proximal, mid and distal RCA as primary reperfusion strategy for acute inferolateral STEMI. 5. Successful right femoral artery Perclose Closure. 6. RFV sheath to be removed subsequently. 7. Bivalirudin infusion for 6 hours. 8. ASA indefinitely. 9. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least ___ year to prevent stent thrombosis. 10. Echocardiogram to assess LVEF. 11. Admit to ___ under CCU Team's Care. 12. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against CAD and STEMI. 13. Neurological evaluation for ? acute neurological event/symptoms. 14. Serial ECGs. 15. Cycle CKMB and platelets. . . IMAGING: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 11: 28 AM FINDINGS: There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction. Sulcal prominence is likely due to age related involution. The ventricles appear normal in size and configuration. There is mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid sinus. Otherwise the imaged paranasal sinuses are well aerated, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are also clear. The bony calvarium is intact. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening. . MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 8: 56 ___ FINDINGS: Portions of the examination are degraded by motion artifact limiting evaluation. Within these confines: MR Brain: There is a small focus of increased signal in the left posterior midbrain on the diffusion-weighted images, with subtle hint of high signal on the T2 images and possible corresponding low signal on the ADC maps, suggesting subacute infarction. There is no evidence of hemorrhage. Ventricular, cisternal, sulcal prominence is consistent with age-related parenchymal volume loss. Flow voids of the major intracranial vessels appear maintained. No gross area of abnormal enhancement is identified. The paranasal sinuses demonstrate scattered areas of mucosal thickening. The mastoid air cells demonstrate normal signal. The sella turcica, craniocervical junction, and orbits are grossly unremarkable. MRA: The images are markedly degraded by motion artifact. No gross abnormality is identified within the anterior or posterior circulation. Apparent irregular narrowing of the distal vessels may be related to atherosclerosis and/or motion artifact. There appears to be flow signal in the petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries. The anterior and middle cerebral or vertebral arteries appear normal. The anterior communicating region appears unremarkable. The posterior cerebral arteries skull is arteries vertebral arteries appear grossly normal. The right vertebral artery is dominant. No definite aneurysm is identified. IMPRESSION: Markedly degraded examination related to patient motion artifact limiting evaluation. Small focus of subacute infarction in the left posterior midbrain. Apparent irregular narrowing of the distal vessels may be related to atherosclerosis and/or motion artifact. .

You had chest pain and symptoms of a stroke and you were taken to the catheterization lab. There was a blockage in your right coronary artery and three drug eluting stents were placed to open up the artery. It is extemely important that you take aspirin and clopidogrel (plavix) ever day without fail to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack. Do not stop taking aspirin and clopidogrel for any reason unless Dr. ___ that it is OK to do so. You had a heart attack and your heart is weaker than before. therefore, it is possible that you might retain fluid in your legs or lungs. Make sure that you weigh yourself every day in the morning before breakfast and call Dr. ___ your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. Your weight at discharge is 163 pounds. Please make sure that you take all of your medicines daily. If you can't afford your refills, please take to Dr. ___ your social worker. It was strongly suggested that you go to rehabilitation before going home. A rehabilitation bed was available but you have decided to go home instead. An appt with your primary care doctor has been set up for tomorrow. You will also have the visiting nurse. ","PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: ___ p/w chest pain, dizziness, R-sided weakness, slurred speech, found to have inferior STEMI and left posterior midbrain CVA. . . LEAVING AMA: The patient left AMA on ___. She had been evaluated by ___ and OT who all felt she required rehab services. Her primary team felt she was at signficant risk for falls given her ataxia and vision problems, as she had fallen and hit her head earlier in the day. The patient understood the risks of her decisions and was competent to make the decision to leave the hospital and go home rather than to an extended care facility. She was given her medications and will have ___ and ___ at home in addition to close follow-up with her PCP. . . ACTIVE ISSUES: ----------------- #) ACS: On presentation to the ED, the patient denied any chest discomfort but was found to have ST segment elevation in the inferolateral leads along with ST segment depression in leads I, aVL, and V1-V2. Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system. The LCMA was long with likely moderate diffuse disease. The LAD was signficant for a long S1 with 70% origin stenosis and otherwise severely diseased after S1 with a recanalized total vs. subtotal occlusion after a small caliber/diffusely diseased D2. There was modest filling of the mid-distal LAD and a large D2 beyond the functional total occlusion. There were septal and apical collaterals filling the RPDA and D2 collaterals supplying the RPL. The CX gave off two high large and modest caliber OM branches. OM3 was small. OM4 was of modest caliber. OM5/LPL was long with minimal luminal irregularities. The distal AV groove CX continued beyond the LPL. The RCA was calcified with a proximal total occlusion with railroad tracking beyond in the mid RCA suggesting a large thrombus burden. There was faint filling of the RCA beyond the total occlusion (TIMI 0 flow). In the cath lab, 3 DES were placed in the ___, mid and distal RCA. She received bivalirudin infusion post-procedure and started on asa and plavix TTE on ___ was signficant for moderate regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF= 30%) c/w multivessel CAD. No LV thrombus seen but imaging of the LV apex was suboptimal. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. She was initially treated with heparin with a plan to bridge to coumadin; however given her extremely high fall risk, the decision was made to hold further anticoagulation with those agents. This issue can be revisited as an outpatient. She was discharged on asa (to be taken indefinitely), plavix (one year), atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol. . #) CVA: Per the patient and the friend who initially found her, she had multiple falls immediately prior to admission and her ""eyes looked wrong."" CT Head was negative for bleed and given her EKG findings she was immediately taken to the cath lab (please see above). After arriving to the ICU, her examination was notable for nystagmus in the right eye on rightward gaze and an inability to adduct her left eye (past midline) as well as posturing of her right arm and dysarthria and possible word finding difficulties. She was evaluated by the Stroke service and MRI showed an acute infarct in the left posterior midbrain. This may have been embolic from her akinetic LV (given her wall motion abnormalities found on echo after her cath), secondary to to emoblism from posterior circulation or small vessel disease given her known hypertension. Per the Stroke neurology service, the stroke likely affected the left MLF resulting in the left INO syndrome. She may also have affected her cerebellar inflow or outflow tracks (causing ataxia and dysarthria). Prior to discharge, an MRA of the neck was performed that was limited by motion artifact. She may benefit from further workup with carotid ultrasounds and CTA neck. Because of her mental status and her recurrent falls, she was not started on coumadin during this admission. . #) Mental status changes: The patient demanded to leave AMA multiple times throughout the admission but had limited judgement or insight. She was unable to recognize the severity of her medical problems or recognize that she was unable to walk or care for herself alone. She also had visual and auditory hallucinations. Psychiatry felt this was delirium and unrelated to her stroke. . #) UTI: Patient had complained of suprapubic tenderness. UA was positive for large leuks and >182 WBC. Bactrim DS x 3 days (day ___ . #) Falls/Instability: Patient reported falling prior to admission. She was evaluated by ___ who felt she remained unstable on her feet and would benefit from rehab prior to returning home. On ___, she fell after urinating on the commode without LOC after feeling a ""rush"" suggestive of vasovagal. She had some external bleeding. ___ showed no evidence of acute intracranial process. . #) Social issues: The patient reported poor adherence to medications secondary to limited finances (taking pills every other or every few days to save money). She met with Social Work and will likely need continued support around this issue. As she left AMA on ___, she was given her medications in hand and educated about the importance of medication adherence. . . CHRONIC ISSUES: ------------------ #) DM-II: Hemoglobin A1c was 7.7. Her oral agents were held and she was kept on a sliding scale and placed on a diabetic diet. She will be discharged on her home medications. . #) HLD: LDL was 101. Her atorvastatin was increased to 80mg. . #) HTN: Blood pressures were monitored (goal <160) and her medications adjusted. She was discharged on lisinopril and metoprolol. . #) GERD: Maintained on home omeprazole. . #) SMOKING: Patient received nicotine patch while admitted and was given counseling about smoking cessation. She will benefit from continued support around this issue. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - The patient left AMA on ___. She would greatly benefit from rehab and physical therapy. She was competent to make this decision and despite the primary team's attempts to convince her otherwise, she left AMA to go home. She will receive ___ and ___ at home and was given her medications in addition to education about the importance of taking them as prescribed. - The patient was found to have apical akinesis on her echocadiogram. Given this and her CHADS2 score of 4, she would likely benefit from further anticoagulation. However, given her mental status and falls, she was not started on coumadin and instead discharged only on asa and plavix. This issue may be re-evalated in the outpatient setting. She may also benefit from carotid ultrasounds and/or CTA neck to futher assess her neck vasculature. - During this admission, she did not identify family members or designate a health care proxy. This may be helpful in the future. - Her medications were adjusted while inpatient. It is unclear how compliant she has been and will likely benefit from close follow-up and further titrating/modification as necessary. - During admission she reported also having a history of possible DVT. This plus her CVA and STEMI may suggest an underlying hypercoaguable disorder that could be further worked up in the outpatient setting. - Code status: full ",5393,1614,12

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear ___, You were admitted to the hospital because of a complication of your diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We think this happened because your insulin pump was not working. You were started on insulin subcutaneously and did well with this but you were discharged to restart the insulin pump at home. The ___ doctors checked your ___ and think that it otherwise was working well except for the battery. You should call the ___ doctor if your blood sugar is more than 200 at any time during the weekend. As a complication of the DKA, your heart had to work harder and you had some transient damage, however, it was improving before discharge. The following changes were made to your medications: - STOP bisoprolol, it is replaced with metoprolol - START metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day to protect your heart - START atorvastatin 80 mg daily for high cholesterol You should followup with your diabetes doctor and your primary care physician. It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital! ","Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p CABG, recent discharge from ___ for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) complicated by ""vagal"" cardiac arrest ___ who presented from OSH (___) for elevated blood sugars and DKA in setting of insulin pump battery malfunction. DKA course was complicated by non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely secondary to demand ischemia. . # DKA: Inciting cause due to insulin pump malfunction. No obvious infection although WBC elevated--urinalysis was negative, no obvious cellulitis or pneumonia. Ischemia is a possible inciting event since she presented with chest pain initially and firt enzymes were negative then trended up, consistent with timing of acute event upon presentation. For the DKA, ___ initially wrote her for sliding scale with lantus but given increased gap, she was switched to insulin drip. Her gap closed on the insulin drip and she was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. She was volume resusciated with normal saline and electrolytes were repleted as necessary. The patient wanted to restart her insulin pump rather than be discharged with subcutaneous insulin. She was restarted and observed for 24 hours before discharge. . # NSTEMI/known CAD: Found to have EKG changes, atypical chest pain and postitive biomarkers concerning for acute coronary syndrome. Dr ___ cardiologist, felt this was more likely type II demand MI given clinical scenario of stress from DKA rather than an NSTEMI as cause for DKA. She was initially started on heparin drip and continued on her aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. She was also started on atorvastatin 80 mg daily and metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg Q6H. The heparin drip was stopped after only a few hours when her chest pain, EKG changes, and biomarkers trended down. She did have an ECHO which showed LVEF of 35%, the same as prior in ___. . # Acute on chronic systolic CHF: EF from past several months ago ~40%. ECHO during this admission consistent with priors, heart failure is due to ischemic heart disease. Because she does have low ejection fraction ischemic heart disease, she should continue on the medications started above. Also, her bisoprolol was changed to metoprolol tartrate because it has been studied better for heart failure patients. She was not discharged on an ACE inhibitor because she had been on them before and ""bottomed out"" her blood pressure. She preferred to not take a second blood pressure medication and will talk with her primary care doctor about this for the future. . # Acute Kidney injury: Likely pre-renal given elevated BUN/Creatinine. Trended down. . # Peripheral vascular disease: Continued clopidogrel. . # Hypothyroidism: continued Levothyroxine TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Needs to have close follow-up with ___ for insulin pump management. Despite insulin pump, her HbA1c was still > 10, so she has poor control of her diabetes - She was started on metoprolol (instead of bisoprolol) during this admission for her heart failure because it has stronger evidene for mortality benefit. She said that sometimes other beta blockers caused her to feel slowing and depression, if this happens with metoprolol, she can be switched. She was started on the short-acting formulation and can be switched to metoprolol succinate (long acting) if she tolerates this. - Needs to be started on an ACE inhibitor for her ischemic systolic heart failure if her blood pressure has room with the new metoprolol.

Patient complains of SOB with any exertion, weakness, and lightheadedness, starting 4 days ago. Saw pcp today and developed chest pain during EKG with radiation to left back. Found to have ST elevation in II, III, avF so sent here for cath. Pt had similar complaints of dyspnea, lightheadedness (likely her anginal equivalent) in ___, underwent cath, found to have 3VD, then got CABG. Has a more remote history (several years ago) of substernal chest pressure, ""elephant sitting on chest"", relieved with nitro, but denied this sort of angina in the preceding months. Of note, also had a recent flare of temporal arteritis, and prednisone was increased to 60mg daily. Pt went straight from PCP to cath lab. Cardiac cath showed 3 vessel native CAD, patent SVG to RCA.
